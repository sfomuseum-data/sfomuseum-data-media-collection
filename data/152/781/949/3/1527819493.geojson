Flag-\nship regulations permit cigar and pipe smoking\nonly when it is not annoying to others-the hal-\nlowed \"greatest good of greatest number\" idea.\nBut cigarettes are always okay.\nAnother \"Please\": Don't smoke (1) while your\nFlagship is on the ground, (2) while you are on\nthe ramp, (3)\nwhile landing or taking off, (4)\nwhile the No SmoKIng sign is on.\nDONT BE\nNO SHOWN\nTHAT EMPTY SEAT\n1. A Flagship-like any ve-\nhicle-is licensed to\ncarry a\ncertain maximum weight load.\nMaybe, on the flight in ques-\ntion, so much of that load was\ndevoted to war cargo that there\nwasn't enough left to accommodate 21 passengers.\n2. Gasoline uses up part of the allowable load.\nAmerican's flights are so scheduled that the neces-\nsary amount of fuel (quantity to be used in flight,\nplus a large reserve) will normally not limit the\npassengers to fewer than 21. However, if winds are\nless favoring than is normal, the necessary amount\nof fuel is greater, and the flight may be restricted\nto fewer passengers.\n3. Maybe somebody was a \"No Show.\" A No\nShow is one who reserves a seat, then neither uses\nit nor releases it for someone else by cancelling the\nspace as soon as possible\nMemos\n\"YOUR MAJESTY\nRANG?\"\nWhenever you want something on a Flagship, just\n-please-touch the button on the wall. The answer-\ning genie-your lady-in-waiting-is the Stewardess.\nShe is here to serve you.\nDID YOU KNOW?\nAspirin, antiseptic, alkaline fizz drinks and such are\nin the Stewardess' Service Kit. Call on her for these\nthings-and especially if you experience any ear\ndistress as air pressure changes with altitude. She\ncan help you remedy-and suggest ways to avoid.\nForm No. T-106A —Printed in U.S.A.\n• ОГ\nther\nrafts\nYOU MAY\nTAKE THE FLIGHT PACKET\nThis Flight Packet is yours.

Down you go to the most comfortable level.\nRelease the button, then, to lock the chair in position.\nNow, call the Stewardess and say \"Pillow\"\nor \"Pillow\nand Blanket\" She will cover you up, tuck you in\nwake you up on schedule.\nand\nON THE HOUSE:\nComplete meals-hot, or cool and\ncrisp as the season warrants - are\nserved on flights that are in the air\nat mealtime.

Later, if you find you've\nlost something ask the Stewardess\nthen, try\nour Lost and Found Dept. No guarantees, of\ncourse, but we may have it there. Inquire through any\nAmerican Airlines' office or write to Lost \u0026 Found Dept.,\nAmerican Airlines System, La Guardia Field, New York\nAirport Station, New York.\nWANT TO WRITE?\nCatch up on old correspondence? Jot\nnotes or write a report? There's a com-\nplete writing kit-stationery, postcards,\ntelegram blanks-in the rack at the front\nof the cabin. Beware of your fountain\npen. Some new\nones—especially\nde-\nsigned for modern living and with an\neye to air travel - won't commit a nui-\nsance aloft. But most older pens are\nground animals. They're apt to belch\nairy ink bubbles when you open them.\n(At flight altitudes air pressure is lower\nthan where they were filled on earth.)\nSo play safe-have the pen full of ink-no room for air.\nOpen it cautiously (or let the Stewardess do it) and\nreplace the cap tightly when you have finished writing.\nTHINGS IN BOTTLES\nperfumes, for instance, are subject to similar leakiness\naloft. Screw-caps are safest-and be sure they're tight.",

      "• - - BECAUSE MORE PLANES ARE IN THE SKY\nMORE EXPRESS SPACE IS AVAILABLE\nYes, the flying machines are flying back. America\nhas achieved fantastic goals of plane production -\nso the government has been releasing additional\nequipment to the airlines. This means that Air Ex- .\npress has been able to find more room for shipments\nthat didn't fly because of war-time space restrictions.\nMore planes mean more flights — and that means\nmore cargo. While much of the equipment released\nwill do double duty carrying both passengers and\ncargo, some of the planes will be used solely to\ntransport Air Mail and Air Express. And a single one\nof these sky giants can carry 6,000 pounds and over.\nFurther, larger and more powerful carriers are on\nthe drawing boards of aviation's designers.\nWhat about war cargo? Priority shipments still\ncome first; non-priority cargo is handled on a space-\navailable basis. But more space is available for all\nshipments — high, low, and non-priority.\nFact is, Air Express has played an important part\nin the war of production. For breakdowns and delays\ncome when least expected. New parts are needed\nfast when a 24-hr. shift has to wait for an ailing\nmachine. Delivery dates get snarled up when some-\none forgets to figure the man-hour shortage. With\nAir Express, you can get parts overnight, or sooner\n— get orders delivered on time — meet, and beat,\nthe deadliest deadlines. Air Express speed has re-\nduced that \"longer\" to a very short time indeed.\nAnd at those lowered rates indicated below, it's a\nmust whenever you've something that must go\nplaces quickly.\nRATES REDUCED as Volume Increased\nNot all services increased their wartime prices!\nAs a direct result of the great volume of Air Express\ntraffic created by wartime demands and the in-\ncreased efficiency developed to satisfy these de-\nmands — Air Express rates within the U. S. were\nactually reduced, in some instances as much as\n12%, depending on the weight of the shipment and\nthe distance it moves. Shippers are saving on an\naverage of 10½% on pre-war Air Express costs.\nExamples of Reduced Rates\nCHARGES ON HEAVIER SHIPMENTS IN PROPORTION\nAir\n1 Ib.\n$1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n3 Ibs.\n$1.04\n1.25\n1.57\n1.90\n2.22\n2.52\n5 Ibs.\n$1.11\n1.52\n2.19\n2.87\n3.54\n4.20\n10 Ibs.\n$1.26\n2.19\n3.74\n5.29\n7.00\n8.40\n25 Ibs.\n$1.75\n4.38\n8.75\n13.13\n17.50\n21.00\nAIR EXPRESS",
      "IMPORTANT\nSTILL\nPACK LIGHTLY -\nCOMPACTLY - in Small Units\nand SHIP WHEN READY!\nDon't pay for superfluous wrappings and trappings\nbut pack securely. Air Express people are trained\nto handle with care and to load scientifically so you\ndon't have to overwrap your shipments.\nSmaller packages often can make earlier planes\nthan bulky ones because they're easier to stow in\nodd corners and this helps to provide extra space.\nBreak your shipments into small units when possible\n- expedite your own deliveries, save time and space\nfor others, help cut your shipping costs.\nAnd Ship When Ready — as early in the day as\npossible. Night flights are more apt to be over-\nloaded. You assure yourself of faster delivery by\nshipping as soon as ready.\n* AIR EXPRESS \"EXTRAS\"\nExtra Service at no extra charge — is\nstill in effect.
