Willard is to fly at this meet is significant.\nThe art of mechanical tights is too new to permit of reference to vet-\neran aviators, but Willard can boast of being the first man in America,\naside from the Wrights and Glenn I. Curtiss, to successiuv operate\nan aeroDiane.\nThe first public fights in this country were made Dy\nless than two vears ago. Mr. Curtiss first pupil was Wil-\nlard, whose ability to handle the dangerous flying machine was dem-\nonstrated with his first attempt at flight. He was trained by Curtiss at\nMineola, and the success which attended his efforts brought him into\nnational ame.\nHe had made but few flights before he manipulated\nthe aeroplane so successin as almost to equal the work ot Curtiss, the\nBy pro\nmechanical engineer, but his inclina-\nTOTES\nmore in the nature of doing things than of planning them.\nThat he is fearless is attested to bw the tact that he is an aeroplanist.\nAlthough the danger attending the operation ot a lying machine\ngeneralliv appreciated no one but those who have town have any con\ncention of the rea extent of the danger.\niter the tateim accident to\nthe government aeroplatte at Ft. Myer, in which Lieut. Seliridge was\nand Orville Wright seriously injured, experts decided that a co!-\numn of air thrown uDward Dr a small wen shed shattered the\npropellor, causing the wreck of the machine.\nWillard has the eye of an\neagle, and his instincts regarding the wind and possible danger are\nsimilar to that of the birds themseives.\nThe machine which Willard will fly\none with which\nCurtiss won the\nScientific American trophy and with which Willard\nhimself won several events at the Los Angeles Meet in January. 1910.\nHis exhibition here will include all of the events which go to make\nuD an avarion meet",
