      "AVIATION MEET, SAN FRANCISCO, 1911\nGlem Gammand Ourtiss\nAlthough few young men of his age have attained equal world wide\ndistinction, Glenn Hammond Curtiss, champion aviator at the age of\n32, finds fame no new thing.\nHe was born in Hammondsport, New York, the son of a Meth-\nodist minister, and was slated for the ministry.\nAs is characteristic of\nhim, however, he had his own way, and chose different lines.\nAt an\nearly period in his life, while attending the public schools, he began a\nseries of experiments in motors, with the end in view of applying a\nsmall motor to a bicycle in order to facilitate the distribution of daily\nnewspapers by which means he was at that time earning a livelihood.\nHe was successful in this experiment continued along this line, so\nthat, at the age of 20, he had perfected a motor cycle of commercial\nvalue.\nShortly afterwards he became a devotee of motorcycle racing.\nIn 1905 he won the first American track championship and two years\nlater, on a machine of his own construction, he traveled a mile at Or-\nmond Beach, Florida, in the remarkable time of twenty-six and two-\nfifths seconds.\nThis record still stands as the fastest mile ever trav-\neled by human being.\nThe aeroplane next came to the attention of Curtiss, and with oth-\ners he formed the Aerial Experiment\nAssociation.\nThis association\ndesigned and built the \"White Wing,\" a biplane which made a number\nof short flights.\nThis was followed by the \"Red Wing,\" and later by\nthe \"June Bug,\"\nwhich was the most successful machine in America\nup to that time.\nOn July 4, 1908, Curtiss, flying the June Bug, won the Scien-\ntific American Trophy, the first aeroplane prize ever offered in Amer-",
      "OFFICIAL SOUVENIR PROGRAM\nica, by a flight of one mile straight away in a little less than two min-\nHe again won the Scientific American Trophy in 1909, at Mine-\nola, L. I.\nAt\nRheims,\nFrance, he\ncompeted with his own aeroplane,\nequipped with a 60-horsepower Curtiss motor, and brought the Gordon-\nBennett Cup to America.\nAt Broscia, Italy, he won first prize for the\nfastest flight of fifty kilometers.\nIn 1910, he established the world's record for quick start by leav-\ning the ground in four and one-fifth seconds from the time of starting\nthe motor.\nHis greatest feat was the winning of the New York World's $10,-\nC00.00 prize by flying from Albany to New York.\nShortly after this feat, while at Hammondsport, N. Y., he conduct-\ned a series of bomb dropping experiments, the first ever tried.\nan aeroplane designed especially for alighting on water, at a height be-\ntween 500 and 1000 feet he scored thirteen hits out of seventeen shots,\na remarkable record.\nAt Atlantic City, during the recent Aviation Meet,\nhe\naston-\nished the officials by climbing to the height of 1500 feet in five minutes\nand fifty-two seconds, the most rapid climb yet made.\nTwo days later\nhe established the record for fifty miles, flying this distance over the\nsea in one hour and fifteen minutes, despite a strong wind which im-\npeded his progress.\nThe Curtiss biplanes have taken the lead in advancing the science\nof\naviation\nalong practical lines during the year.\nIn cross-country\nflights, bomb\ndropping\nexperiments,\ndemonstrations of aerial sharp-\nshooting, flying from deck of a vessel, and probably most important\nof all, in transmitting a wireless message from an aeroplane in flight,\nthe Curtiss biplanes have done more to demonstrate the practicability\nof the aeroplane as an adjunct to military and naval forces, than any\nother flyer.\nIt will be further demonstrated here by others of the men\nwho have been pioneers in these experiments.\nCURTISS BIPLANE.\nL HOLO DY",
      "AVIATION MEET, SAN FRANCISCO, 1911\nEugene B. Fly\nEugene B. Ely, who is to fly here, while the youngest of the avi-\nators flying Curtiss biplanes, has rapidly forged to the front among the\nbest known aviators of the world.\nHe has two distinctions which mark\nhim out among aviators.\nHe learned to fly without instruction, that is,\nby just flying, and he was the first man to demonstrate the heavier\nthan air flying machine before the kite loving people of Japan.\nWhen the aeroplane\nwas first demonstrated a success, Ely was\nknown on the Pacific Coast best known as a driver of racing automo-\nbiles.\nHe was one of the first Americans to become an expert auto\ndriver.\nDetermined to get into the air game early, he took charge of\nan aeroplane owned by a wealthy westerner who had nobody to fly it.\nHe later purchased the machine and by his successful flights attracted\nHe made a well paying\nthe attention of 19 i Id the Curtis own Hom de te iportant\ntour of Japan in 1910.\nevents, and was chosen to fly the specially built Curtiss machine at\nBelmont Park, N. Y.\nWhen it was proposed by the Curtiss Company to demonstrate\nthe possibility of an aeroplane flying from a ship at sea, Ely was se-\nlected to try the experiment and on\nNovember 14, 1910, he\nlected to try the fightinent and eck of the U.S. Cruiser Birmingham.\nThe cruiser was anchored off Hampton Roads, about five miles from\nWilloughby Beach, and the weather was such that all hope of flight was\nabandoned by naval authorities, when Ely and his mechanician began\na motor test.\nthe\nsignal\nImmediately afterwards when the rain ceased, Ely gave\nand the machine was released, running rapidly down the\nstarting way.\nHis machine dipped until the wheels touched the water,\nsplashing enough to rip a piece out of his propellor.\nHe continued the\nflight, however, distancing the torpedo boats, and made a safe land-\ning on a narrow strip of beach.\nDue to this experiment, the naval au-\nthorities have taken up aeronautics.",
      "OFFICIAL SOUVENIR PROGRAM\nCharles H. Willarn\nThe fact that Charles F. Willard is to fly at this meet is significant.\nThe art of mechanical flights is too new to permit of reference to vet-\neran aviators, but Willard can boast of being the first man in America,\naside from the Wrights and Glenn H. Curtiss, to successfully operate\nan aeroplane.\nThe first public flights in this country were made by\nCurtiss less than two years ago.\nMr. Curtiss'\nfirst pupil was Wil-\nlard, whose ability to handle the dangerous flying machine was dem-\nonstrated with his first attempt at flight.\nHe was trained by Curtiss at\nMineola, and the success which attended his efforts brought him into\nnational fame. Ile had made but few flights before he manipulated\nthe aeroplane so successful as almost to equal the work of Curtiss, the\nmaster.\nBy profession Willard is a mechanical engineer, but his inclina-\ntions are more in the nature of doing things than of planning them.\nThat he is fearless is attested to by the fact that he is an aeroplanist.\nAlthough the danger attending the operation of a flying machine is\ngenerally appreciated, no one but those who have flown have any con-\nception of the real extent of the danger.\nAfter the fateful accident to\nthe government aeroplane at Ft. Myer, in which Lieut. Selfridge was\nkilled and Orville Wright seriously injured, experts decided that a col-\numn of air\nthrown upward by a small wooden shed shattered the\npropellor, causing the wreck of the machine.\nWillard has the eye of an\neagle, and his instincts regarding the wind and possible danger are\nsimilar to that of the birds themselves.\nThe machine\nwhich Willard will fly here is the one with which\nCurtiss won the Scientific American trophy and with which Willard\nhimself won several events at the Los Angeles Meet in January, 1910.\nHis exhibition here will include all of the events which go to make\nup an aviation meet.",
      "AVIATION MEET, SAN FRANCISCO, 1911\nJames Ranley\nProbably one of the most daring aerialists is Mr. James Radley, of\nEngland, who has achieved international fame as an aviator.\nAt the Aviation Meet at Lanark,\nScotland, on August 15, 1910,\nRadley performed what is probably the most marvelous descent ever\nattempted by any aviator.\nDue to the sudden back-firing of his en-\ngine, followed immediately by the breaking of his crank shaft, Radley\npointed his aeroplane (a Bleriot) earthward and descended 1300 feet on\na perpendicular plane in the wonderful time of nine seconds, right-\ning his plane and alighting safely.\nThe barograph record showed a\nperfectly vertical line in recording this descent.\nRadley, at the same meet, captured the speed record for one mile\nstraight away, covering the distance at the terrific speed of 77.6 miles\nper hour.\nOn his Bleriot he again flew a mile straight away in 47 and\n2-3 seconds, equivalent to 75.95 miles per hour.\nThe world's record for\nspeed had been previously held by Morane, who, at Rheims, traveled at\nthe rate of 65.3 miles per hour over a 7½-mile course.\nAt this same meet Radley established the British record for quick\nstart, leaving the ground in fifty-seven feet run.\nBLERIOT MONOPLANE.\n—Photo by Amer.\nress Ass.",
