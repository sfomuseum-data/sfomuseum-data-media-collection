Or the Red Devil?\nOnly a few years ago, when auto-\nmobiles were risky and freakish play-\nthings,\nthose were names to\nconjure\nwith —phantom machines that dashed at\nforty miles an hour along graded dirt\nroads, followed by pillars of dust and\nfumes of oil, pursued by frantic dogs\nand the derisive yells of village skeptics.\nDo you remember the epoch-making\nGlidden tours across a few hundred\nmiles of New England hills? Do you\nremember the Vanderbilt Cup Races,\nwith thousands of holiday-makers banked\naround dangerous curves, thrilled with\nthe hope of seeing a smash-up?\nOnly a few years before that, horses\nwere running wild and cattle stam-\npeding at the hoarse shriek of the loco-\nmotive...\nAnd prayers were offered regularly\nfor those in peril on the sea.\nRemember these\nthings-for they\nhappened in our time!\nToday giant liners are ferrying hun-\ndreds ot thousands of tourists across the\noceans. Limited trains glide on roller\nbearings, safeguarded at every turn of\nthe wheel by automatic controls.\nAnd\n22,000,000\nautomobiles have\nturned\nthe thoughts of everyone in this country\noutward-\n-outward along smooth high-\nways of asphalt and concrete.\nNow look to the skies for dawn!\nA new industrial and commercial era\nis commencing, just as surely as new\neras commenced with steamboats, with\nthe railroad, and the automobile.\nTheir\ndawns were marked\nwith misgivings\nand catastrophes that befogged the popu-\nlar vision.\nAnd similarly, the\nheroic recklessness that the hazards of\nwar made necessary, the dramatic dar-\ning of pioneers trying their wings beyond\nthe realms of known safety, the foolish\nadventures of unskilled fliers in obsolete\nmachines have diverted public attention\nfrom what is going on in the solid, safe\ndevelopment of air transportation.\nWe will awake some early day to\nrealize that a new and tremendous force\nhas entered national life. It does not\nimply the obsolescence of old-established\nmeans of transportation.\nIt means a\nsudden extension of the capabilities of\nman —the power to reach hitherto in-\naccessible\nspots unerringly\nand\nwith\ngreat swiftness,\nmeans of leaping\ngeographical boundaries in perfect com-\nfort and safety, another triumph over\nall-consuming\nTime.\nEveryone is familiar with the spec-\ntacular achievements in aviation during\nthe past year.\nEveryone has come to\nknow names such as Le Bourget, Croy-\ndon, Tempelhof, Mineola, and the Ford\nAirport at Detroit—principally because\nof dramatic events associated with them.\nBut not so many realize that in a recent\nsurvey of one hundred American flying\nconcerns, there were only two fatalities\nin five million miles of flight.\nThe all-metal planes of the Ford\nMotor Company have already flown on\nregular schedules, carrying freight,\ndistance of 700,000 miles.\nAnd it\nis in the well-founded belief that the\nairplane has brought in a new industrial\nfactor of the first importance, that the\nFord Motor Company is devoting re-\nsources to research, experimentation, and\nsound\nproduction in this\nnew\nand\nrapidly expanding field.\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY",
