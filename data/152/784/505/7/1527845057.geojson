A delightful wine to drink at any\ntime, with seafood or spicy dishes.\nMITCHELTON\nGOULBURN VALLEY SHIRAZ 1996\nMITCHELTON\nAustralia's Goulburn Valley has been producing Shiraz of remarkable\ndepth and flavour for more than 130 years, a tradition that continues\nwith Mitchelton Goulburn Valley Shiraz.\nThe hallmarks of this wine are intense fruit flavours and a rounded,\nmouth-filling texture. The wine is matured in oak barrels for 16 month:\nand blended with small amounts of Grenache and Mourvedre to add\nfurther earthiness and spice. The 1990 vintage offers a warm, mulberry\nfruit aroma with a velvety, well-balanced palate - the perfect\naccompaniment to beef or lamb dishes\nPORT\nTHE CHAIRMAN'S LATE BOTTLED PORT\nLike \"Vintage Port\", this is the wine of a single year but bottled\nafter o years in cask rather than 2 years and it is, therefore, ready\nfor drinking shortly after bottling.\nThe wine is from a single vineyard, the Qunita's Santa Madalena,\nwhich lies on the eastern slopes of the Kio Torta. This is the best part\nof the Douro Valley, the only place Fort wine can be produced.\nThis wine from the 1989 vintage has a delightful palate full of\nrichly concentrated fruit. It has a wonderful depth of flavour and in\nthe style of very fine Port, is long, well balanced and delicious to\ndrink.\nThe Chairman's\nLATE BOILED\nPORT\n39cl",
