Enjoy!\"\nWHITES\nSebastiani Chardonnay, Sonoma, California, 2006\nThis wine is absolutely seductive, with full-blown exotic\nmango-pineapple fruit, creamy butterscotch oak, a snappy acidity\nthat gives it balance and lovely food affinity. Enjoy it with hard cheeses,\nrisotto, grilled fish and shellfish.\nFULL BODIED\nOcchio a Vento Vermentino, Tuscany, Italy, 2006\nAsin per are veto Veerin, us on white steper grape that is\nre-emerging in that region.

The Sangiovese gives a savory brightness to the\ncherry-raspberry fruit, while the Alicante lends a meaty, savory\nbalsamic-licorice note. It is very complex, layered and spicy -\ntailor-made for garlicky meat dishes and cheesy pastas or risottos.\nMEDIUM BODIED\nDESSERT WINES\nGraham 's Late Bottled Vintage Porto, Portugal, 2003\nDecadence, decanted. The dense chocolate-dipped fig and spicy plum\npudding notes of this wine are perfect with blue cheese or chocolate.\nOr just by itself!\nFULL BODIED\nJurançon Prestige, Cave de Gan Jurançon, France, NV\nThis is honeyed pears and peaches in a glass, with soft floral,\nquince paste and candied apricot overtones. Delicious with cheeses,\nice cream, or just on its own.\nLIGHT BODIED\nSPARKLING WINE\nScharffenberger Brut Sparkling Wine, California, NV\nThe fragrance of white flowers and baking pastry compliments an\nappley-crisp flavor with notes of lychee and yellow plums.\nThe creamy texture and long finish make it a pleasure on its own,\nbut it is also delicious with salads, light fish dishes,\nsalty snacks and hard cheeses.\nLIGHT BODIED",
