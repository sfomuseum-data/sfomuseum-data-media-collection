      "CHAMPAGNE POMMES\nCHAMPAGNE POMMERY.\nThe \"Cuvée\" Louise Pommery was created as a tri-\nbute to Louise Pommery, the lady who, by her love\nof natural elegance, ushered the first \"Champagne\nBout\" into the world in 1874\nLouise Pommery, who had a livelv, inventive\nmind, had the idea of serving to some of her closest\ntriends a Champagne which was made without any\naddition of sugar. She, hersell, approved of this\nnew sivic o wine. which she found pleasant and\nattractive.\nLoyal to its principles of quality in the blending\nof vintage wines, Pommery prepares the \"Cuvée\"\nLouise Pommery with wines from a single. excep.\ntional year.\nIn line with the traditional Pommery taste, the\n\"Cuvee Louise Pommery has an attractively sharp\nnose, a discreet aroma of Chardonnay and on the\npalate it is smooth, fresh and balanced with a long.\nlight after-taste.\nThe unique character of the \"Cuvée\" lies in its\nexceptional harmony and clantv. the exquisite\nQuality of the bouquet and the lavor\nCHARDONNAY\nROBERT MONDAVI CHARDONNAY 1982.\nAll the grapes which went into this wine were\ngrown in Napa Valley, California. After fermenta-\ntion, the wine was aged for 10 months in French\nbarrels, which contributed roundness and\nfinesse to the final blend.\nThis 1982 Chardonnay combines intense fruiti-\nness with depth and complexity. It is a wine of both\ncrispness and charm, which will complement\nlarge number of entrées.\nCHATEAU DE MEURSAULT\nAPPELLATION MEURSAULT CONTROLÉE\nSE on sos\nMEURSATIT\nPROPRASTAIRE A MINISALLE, COMBOTOR, PRANCE\nFRANCE\nCHATEAU DE MEURSAULT 1984.\nChardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes give in Cöte-\nd'Or the greatest wines of Burgundy and Meur-\nsault. The Château de Meursault 1984 has a golden\ngreen color and is brilliant and clear. This wine is\nvery trank in taste and has a slight aroma of nuts.\nGRAND CRU CLASSE\n1982\nCHATE AV\nSMITH HAVT LAFITTE\nGRAVES\nAPPELLATION GRAVES CONTROLEE\nMIS IN BOUTEILLE AU CHATEAU\nCHATEAU SMITH HAUT LAFITTE 1982.\nGirves is known chietly for its pleasant while\nwines, but it also produces some outstanding reds.\nSmith Haut Lafitte 1982 is distinctly Graves and\nembodies the finest characteristics of the region.\nIt is an elegant wine with a deep color and a\nfine bouquet, which recalls the aroma of fruit with\nhints of oakwood\nSeph Drouhin\nVOSNE.ROMANÊE\nJOSEPI\nVOSNEPRO MANES 984 \u0026 1985.\nIssued from vineyards located around the famous\nvillage of Vosne Romanée, this wine is a typical ex-\nample of Burgundy. Full of elegance and complex-\nity, and reminiscent of mushrooms and truffles.\nWhen our stock of the 1984 vintage is exhausted,\nit will be succeeded by the equally elegant and fine\nwine from 1985\nWHISKY.\n\"A good whisky should have a pleasant aroma of\npeat, flowers and alcohol which comes off espe-\ncially in a warmed glass\", notes the well known\nconnoisseur R.J.S. McDowall in, \"The Whiskies\nof Scotland\".\nAside from Scotch whiskies there are three\nother major types: American, Canadian and Irish.\nRegardless of its origins, whisky knows no\nboundaries. It's truly cosmopolitan and enjoved\nby people the world over.\nIt leaves no one indifferent. It enjoys a love and\nhate, take it or leave it relationship.\nThose who didn Know what to ook for in a\nfine whisky have been converted after learning\nwhat to appreciate in a mine mall or blench\nWe are proud to present a sophisticated selec-\ntion of high quality whiskies. Of them all, Royal\nSalute, which has been aged for 21 years, is prob-\nably the most appreciated.\nBut since one's relationship to whisky is a very\ndelicate matter, not to say intimate, we leave the\nfinal decision up to you. So whatever you choose,\nwe are happy to serve the very best: Royal Salute,\nChivas Regal, Glenlivet, Seagram's V.O., and Jack\nDaniel's Black Label.\nOTHER DRINKS AND CORDIALS\nCOCKTAILS\nSHERRY:\nDon Zoilo Fino\nGIN:\nTanqueray\nVODKA:\nAbsolnt\nCOGNAC:\nRenault X.O.\nLIQUEURS:\nCherry Heering,\nDrambuie,\nCointreau, Grand Marnier\nPORT:\nQuinta do Noval (10 years old)"
