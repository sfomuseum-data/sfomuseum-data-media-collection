    "media:imagetext": "The wines served aboard United's flights are chosen in consultation\nwith Doug Frost, columnist and author (On Wine, 2001; Uncorking Wine, 1996).\nMr. Frost has been nominated for the prestigious James Beard Foundation Award\nand is one of only three people in the world to hold both the title of Master Sommelier\nand Master of Wine. Mr. Frost and United Airlines have taken a truly global perspective\nin selecting wines for your appreciation and enjoyment. À votre santé!\nfeatured wines\nYour flight attendant will inform you of today's selections.\nSome of these wines may only be available on selected flights.\nChampagne\nPol Roger Brut NV Champagne\nPol Roger enjoys a reputation as one of the most consistent producers in Champagne,\ncreating a sparkling wine that is wildly rich and still balanced. That balance allows play\nbetween fruitiness and earthiness: nutty, rich and juicy, with toast, pear and apple flavors\nat the very long end.\nPommery Brut Royal NV Champagne\nPommery creates one of the most elegant of Champagnes, and their Brut Royal\nalways exhibits grace and softness. Elegance doesn't have to preclude complexity;\ntheir classic wine shows gentle pear, lemon and earth flavors.\nWhite Wine\nLabouré-Roi 2004 Chablis (Chardonnay)\nWhere California goes for the richness of buttered toast with its Chardonnays, Chablis (a\nsubregion of Burgundy) is poised, earthy and tart with orange and green apple aromas.\nDomaine Vincent Sauvestre 2004 Chablis (Chardonnay)\nChardonnay is a chameleon of a grape; in California and Australia, it can be gooey and\nbuttery. But the producers in Chablis (a subregion of Burgundy) seem unconcerned with\nChardonnay's more ample proportions and create a leaner, stonier version of the grape.\nPowers Chardonnay 2003 Columbia Valley\nWhile California has built a reputation on buttery Chardonnay, Washington's best\nChardonnays have even better balance between richness and crispness,\ncombining spiced pears and buttered toast, such as this beauty from Powers.\nVan Loveren Sauvignon Blanc 2005 Robertson\nWhile New Zealand has become famous for a dramatic and herbal style of\nSauvignon Blanc, the best versions of that grape in South Africa tend to be\nmore restrained and balanced.\nRed Wine\nE. Guigal 2001 Côtes du Rhône\nGuigal enjoys a reputation as one of the benchmark producers in the Rhône Valley.\nWith the grapes Grenache and Syrah in the mix, the aromas are of raspberries\nand red cherries, and the flavors are powerful, chocolatey and warm.\nTaurus Roble Tempranillo 2003 Toro\nSpain is the hot new thing in the international marketplace, even though they've been\nmaking wine for a few thousand years. The grape used, Tempranillo, seems to be able\nto make traditional and soft wine as well as lush, juicy New World-styled wines,\nsuch as this one\nLockwood Merlot 2002 Monterey\nIn the last few years, some remarkable Merlots have been coming out of Monterey.\nThe wine starts soft and friendly, with blueberries and chocolate, the flavors and power\nseem to grow and the finish goes on and on.\nClos du Bois Zinfandel 2003 North Coast\nZinfandel has a sweet spot on the planet, it's the northern part of Sonoma.\nIt has intensity of fruit allied with the spice of American oak.\nWarburn Premium Reserve Shiraz 2005 Southeastern Australia\nWarburn offers an ideal example of the character of Australian Shiraz,\nwith coconut, blackberry and cassis flavors.\nBeverages\nApéritifs, cocktails, spirits, liqueurs and beer\nSandeman Founders Reserve Porto will be offered during the main meal's dessert.\nSTARBUCKS. coffee will be available throughout the flight.\n291C001-2\nto begin\nDried beef and marinated prawns with asparagus tips and tomato*\nMustard dill mayonnaise\nFresh seasonal greens\nCreamy wasabi or raspberry vinaigrette\nmain course\nPan-seared filet mignon with shallot balsamic demi-glace*\nPotato mushroom casserole and sautéed vegetables with shiitake mushrooms\nOven-roasted breast of chicken with blueberry peppercorn sauce\nWhite and wild rice medley, blanched broccoli and roasted pumpkin\nFillet of salmon with lemon myrtle cream sauce\nParslied château potatoes and a mixed vegetable sauté\nPlease advise the flight attendant if you prefer to have sauce served on the side\ndessert\nInternational cheese selection\nBrie, St. Claire\nHazelnut nougat cake\nmidflight snack\nA variety of sandwiches and assorted treats\nprior to arrival\nYour selected entree will be served\nwith breakfast breads, butter and fruit preserves\nAsparagus and Gouda cheese filled omelette\nGrilled smoked chicken, baked Roma tomato half\nFresh seasonal fruit plate with creamy yogurt\n* Today's menu features beef from Australia.\nWe apologize if occasionally your choice is not available.\n11/06\nSYD-LAX/SFO (LD83-S89-B87)\nLOTUUUT C",

      "The wines served aboard United's flights are chosen in consultation\nwith Doug Frost, columnist and author (On Wine, 2001; Uncorking Wine, 1996).\nMr. Frost has been nominated for the prestigious James Beard Foundation Award\nand is one of only three people in the world to hold both the title of Master Sommelier\nand Master of Wine. Mr. Frost and United Airlines have taken a truly global perspective\nin selecting wines for your appreciation and enjoyment. À votre santé!\nfeatured wines\nYour flight attendant will inform you of today's selections.\nSome of these wines may only be available on selected flights.\nChampagne\nPol Roger Brut NV Champagne\nPol Roger enjoys a reputation as one of the most consistent producers in Champagne,\ncreating a sparkling wine that is wildly rich and still balanced. That balance allows play\nbetween fruitiness and earthiness: nutty, rich and juicy, with toast, pear and apple flavors\nat the very long end.\nPommery Brut Royal NV Champagne\nPommery creates one of the most elegant of Champagnes, and their Brut Royal\nalways exhibits grace and softness. Elegance doesn't have to preclude complexity;\ntheir classic wine shows gentle pear, lemon and earth flavors.\nWhite Wine\nLabouré-Roi 2004 Chablis (Chardonnay)\nWhere California goes for the richness of buttered toast with its Chardonnays, Chablis (a\nsubregion of Burgundy) is poised, earthy and tart with orange and green apple aromas.\nDomaine Vincent Sauvestre 2004 Chablis (Chardonnay)\nChardonnay is a chameleon of a grape; in California and Australia, it can be gooey and\nbuttery. But the producers in Chablis (a subregion of Burgundy) seem unconcerned with\nChardonnay's more ample proportions and create a leaner, stonier version of the grape.\nPowers Chardonnay 2003 Columbia Valley\nWhile California has built a reputation on buttery Chardonnay, Washington's best\nChardonnays have even better balance between richness and crispness,\ncombining spiced pears and buttered toast, such as this beauty from Powers.\nVan Loveren Sauvignon Blanc 2005 Robertson\nWhile New Zealand has become famous for a dramatic and herbal style of\nSauvignon Blanc, the best versions of that grape in South Africa tend to be\nmore restrained and balanced.\nRed Wine\nE. Guigal 2001 Côtes du Rhône\nGuigal enjoys a reputation as one of the benchmark producers in the Rhône Valley.\nWith the grapes Grenache and Syrah in the mix, the aromas are of raspberries\nand red cherries, and the flavors are powerful, chocolatey and warm.\nTaurus Roble Tempranillo 2003 Toro\nSpain is the hot new thing in the international marketplace, even though they've been\nmaking wine for a few thousand years. The grape used, Tempranillo, seems to be able\nto make traditional and soft wine as well as lush, juicy New World-styled wines,\nsuch as this one\nLockwood Merlot 2002 Monterey\nIn the last few years, some remarkable Merlots have been coming out of Monterey.\nThe wine starts soft and friendly, with blueberries and chocolate, the flavors and power\nseem to grow and the finish goes on and on.\nClos du Bois Zinfandel 2003 North Coast\nZinfandel has a sweet spot on the planet, it's the northern part of Sonoma.\nIt has intensity of fruit allied with the spice of American oak.\nWarburn Premium Reserve Shiraz 2005 Southeastern Australia\nWarburn offers an ideal example of the character of Australian Shiraz,\nwith coconut, blackberry and cassis flavors.\nBeverages\nApéritifs, cocktails, spirits, liqueurs and beer\nSandeman Founders Reserve Porto will be offered during the main meal's dessert.\nSTARBUCKS. coffee will be available throughout the flight.\n291C001-2\nto begin\nDried beef and marinated prawns with asparagus tips and tomato*\nMustard dill mayonnaise\nFresh seasonal greens\nCreamy wasabi or raspberry vinaigrette\nmain course\nPan-seared filet mignon with shallot balsamic demi-glace*\nPotato mushroom casserole and sautéed vegetables with shiitake mushrooms\nOven-roasted breast of chicken with blueberry peppercorn sauce\nWhite and wild rice medley, blanched broccoli and roasted pumpkin\nFillet of salmon with lemon myrtle cream sauce\nParslied château potatoes and a mixed vegetable sauté\nPlease advise the flight attendant if you prefer to have sauce served on the side\ndessert\nInternational cheese selection\nBrie, St. Claire\nHazelnut nougat cake\nmidflight snack\nA variety of sandwiches and assorted treats\nprior to arrival\nYour selected entree will be served\nwith breakfast breads, butter and fruit preserves\nAsparagus and Gouda cheese filled omelette\nGrilled smoked chicken, baked Roma tomato half\nFresh seasonal fruit plate with creamy yogurt\n* Today's menu features beef from Australia.\nWe apologize if occasionally your choice is not available.\n11/06\nSYD-LAX/SFO (LD83-S89-B87)\nLOTUUUT C"
