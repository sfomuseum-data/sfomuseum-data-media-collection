Marvels of engineering skill, these\nveritable liners of the sky which span the Caribbean Sea\nand the rim of the Atlantic to far off Rio de Janeiro and\nBuenos Aires-\nand their sister ship land transports which\nfly to Mexico, Central America and down the west coast to\nthe southern continent and over the Andes to Argentina-\npresent for the first time luxurious travel accommodations\nunmatched by any other means of travel.\nThese famous Clipper Ships are aerial giants, whose four\nengines are more powerful than an average locomotive.\nTheir dimensions are larger than ships in which Columbus\nfirst crossed the Atlantic. Their appointments are a revela-\ntion of what modern travel luxury can be. They carry a\ncrew of six Captain, Co-Pilot, Radio Operator, Flight\nEngineer, Purser and Steward.\nBuilt for service over ocean waters these huge stream-\nlined flying boats, weighing seventeen and nineteen tons,\nprovide luxurious comfort for 32 and 40 passengers in\ncabins, each larger than a full size railroad car compart-\nment, sound proofed and automatically ventilated. Smok-\ning compartments, promenade aisles fifty feet long, full-\nvisioned windows and a buffet from which luncheons and\nrefreshments are served during flight, are some of the\nunique features of these famous airliners.\nThese are the ships in which you travel to the Bahamas\nand to Cuba, to the West Indies, to Jamaica, across the\nCaribbean Sea to Colombia, Venezuela and Panama and\ndown the South American east coast, through the Guianas\nand over contal Brazil to the great metropolises of Rio de\nOver the great aerial trade routes of the Pan American,\nfollowing the pioneer trails blazed by Lindbergh to the\nlands of the West Indies and Central and South America,\nyou travel along great highways of the sky, reared by the\noutstanding air\ntransport system of the world. You are\nunder the watchful care of 3,000 trained experts who are\nstationed through 33 countries to speed your airliner and\nits important cargoes to the trade centers of the Western\nHemisphere.\nOver the romantic trails of Columbus, of Spanish Con-\nquistadores, of swashbuckling pirateers, of Clipper Ships\nof another age, you speed along radio-guarded routes to\narrive at your destination, entranced at the ease of your\npassage, refreshed and enthusiastic for the holiday ahead\njust as more than four hundred thousand other Pan\nAmerican passengers have flown one hundred and fifty\nmillion miles along these airways over the Americas.\nFrom Brownsville, Texas, central aerial gateway to the\nsouthern Americas, you travel on the famous Douglas air-\nliners, great twin-engined, highly streamlined transports\nwhich have established new records for speed-\n-and travel\nluxury—in the United States and in Europe.\nIn sound-proofed cabins, roomy reclining chairs are\nfitted to wide windows from which may be had an unob-\nstructed view of the interesting cities and the vivid land-\nscape of Mexico and Central America. These great airliners\nalso operate along the west coast of South America through\nPeru and Chile and make the spectacular crossing of the\nAndes to Argentina on the east, thus completing the aerial\ncircuit of the southern continent.\nManned by a crew of four-\n•Captain, Co-Pilot, Radio\nOperator and Purser-\n-these airliners carry 14 passengers in\naddition to mail and express at an effortless speed of three\nmiles a minute bringing Mexico City within a few hours of\nthe United States and making all of the glamorous re-\npublics of Central America accessible within a single day's\ncruise from that capital.\nFrom Los Angeles, the international gateway of the\nwestern United States, twin-engined Lockheed airliners,\nfastest in the world, fly between the Pacific coast and lower\nCalifornia to Mexico City offering the same outstanding\ntravel advantages as the Douglas airliners do on the cen-\ntral routes. Similar fast service from El Paso provides a\ndirect air-travel route through Central Mexico from the\nUnited States.\nWherever you go \"via Pan American\" you travel in the\nfinest equipment aeronautical science has yet produced,\nconfident in the care of what has demanded universal\nrecognition as the outstanding air transport system in the\nworld, which has set a new travel standard of efficiency\nunequalled by any form of transportation.\nThese advantages offer you the finest of travel accom-\nmodations.

These great airliners\nalso operate along the west coast of South America through\nPeru and Chile and make the spectacular crossing of the\nAndes to Argentina on the east, thus completing the aerial\ncircuit of the southern continent.\nManned by a crew of four-\n•Captain, Co-Pilot, Radio\nOperator and Purser-\n-these airliners carry 14 passengers in\naddition to mail and express at an effortless speed of three\nmiles a minute bringing Mexico City within a few hours of\nthe United States and making all of the glamorous re-\npublics of Central America accessible within a single day's\ncruise from that capital.\nFrom Los Angeles, the international gateway of the\nwestern United States, twin-engined Lockheed airliners,\nfastest in the world, fly between the Pacific coast and lower\nCalifornia to Mexico City offering the same outstanding\ntravel advantages as the Douglas airliners do on the cen-\ntral routes. Similar fast service from El Paso provides a\ndirect air-travel route through Central Mexico from the\nUnited States.\nWherever you go \"via Pan American\" you travel in the\nfinest equipment aeronautical science has yet produced,\nconfident in the care of what has demanded universal\nrecognition as the outstanding air transport system in the\nworld, which has set a new travel standard of efficiency\nunequalled by any form of transportation.\nThese advantages offer you the finest of travel accom-\nmodations.
