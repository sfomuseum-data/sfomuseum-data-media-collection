      "ADELTA AIR LINES\nGuide for\nChildren\nTraveling\nAlone\nThat's the Delta\nSpirit!*",
      "attendants have received extensive first-aid\ntraining. In the event of serious illness, on Delta's\ndomestic system our flights are seldom more than\n20 minutes from an airport where emergency\nservices are available.\nWe hope we've answered most of your questions\nabout children traveling alone on Delta and removed\nany possible sources of concern. We would be\nhappy to explain specific requirements regarding\nyour child or handle your special requests.\nJust give Delta or your favorite Travel Agent a call.\nKnow, too, that you'll be giving your child more\nthan just a wonderful trip. You'll be giving him\nmemories that last a lifetime.\nTHAT'S THE\nDELTA SPIRIT!™\n© Delta Air Lines 9/84\nPrinted in U.S.A.\nForm 0412-80738\nBrochure 11-84\n2003,105, 373",
      "DELTA'S\nPASSENGERS\nARE SPECIAL\nPEOPLE\nAnd children are some\nof our very best travelers\nWe're often asked, \"Can my child travel alone?\",\n\"What arrangements do I need to make?\",\n, and\n\"How will Delta take care of my child?\". It is our\npleasure to offer this pamphlet as an answer to those\nquestions. We've designed it with you in mind—a\nguide for parents or guardians of children traveling\nunaccompanied on Delta Air Lines. To make it easy\nto read, we've highlighted your responsibilities in blue.\nSo if you're unable to travel with your child, relax-\nlet Delta's Professionals assist you.\nConditions of\nacceptance\nYour child may travel alone on Delta if he is at least\n5 years of age. Children under 5 are considered\ntoo young to travel alone and must be accompanied\nby a responsible person at least 12 years of age.\nUnaccompanied children pay the full applicable\nadult fare.\nThere are two general provisions that apply to\nchildren traveling alone. Delta will accept\nunaccompanied minors for domestic transportation\nprovided that:\n1) The child is brought to the airport of origina-\ntion by a parent or responsible adult who will\nremain with the child until the aircraft is\nboarded, and furnishes satisfactory evidence\nthat the child will be met by another parent\nor responsible adult at the destination airport.\n2) There are no pre-existing weather conditions\nor other known operating irregularities that\nmight prevent the flight from landing at the\ndestination airport.\nIn addition, children 5, 6, and 7 years of age must\nuse Delta for the entire trip—one-plane through\nservice with no change of aircraft from origin to\ndestination. Those children who are at least 8 years\nof age are accepted for all flights, including Delta-to-\nDelta connections and connections to and from\nother airlines. However, reservations must be\nconfirmed to the destination. Please keep in mind,\ntoo, that some airlines have acceptance practices\nwhich differ from Delta's, including restrictions\non the hours during which unaccompanied children\nmay travel. Also, if there is any question as to\nthe child's age, a birth certificate may be\nrequested.\nDelta will accept unaccompanied children for\ninternational travel subject to the same conditions\nas domestic travel shown above. In addition and with\nreference only to those 5, 6, and 7 years old,\nthe flight cannot be scheduled to stop in a country\nother than the country of origin or destination.\nAnd, of course, all children must possess the\nnecessary travel documents (passport, visas, etc.)\nDelta will be happy to provide full details in this\nregard as well as international fare information\nwhen you call for reservations.\nMaking Reservations\nPart of the fun of traveling alone is in the anticipation\nof it. Let your child share in that by including him\nin the travel plans and decisions whenever possible.\nHe's more likely to accept the responsibility of\ntraveling alone knowing that you trust him. At the\ntime reservations are made, our agent will need\nto know:\n1) The name and age of your child;\n2) The name, address, and telephone\nnumber of the adult who will be respon-\nsible for bringing the child to the airport;\n3) The name, address, and telephone\nnumber of the adult who will be respon-\nsible for meeting the child at the\ndestination airport.\nYour child should know, or have, all of this\ninformation with him as he travels too.\nAt the Airport\nWhen checking in for the flight, please advise\nour ticket agent that your child is traveling\nalone. He will complete a special \"On-Board\nMessage\" with all pertinent information concerning\nthe unaccompanied status of your child. If your\nreservation requires a change of plane to\nanother airline, it will also be necessary to\ncomplete and sign an Unaccompanied Minor\nInformation Form. Both forms will accompany\nyour child's ticket. You should plan to remain\nat the airport until the child has boarded and\nthe aircraft has departed.\nWe want to assure you that Delta will take good\ncare of your child from the time of acceptance\nuntil he is met by the party specified at the desti-\nnation. Our agent will affix a special button to\nyour child's outer garment for identification\npurposes. Then he will be escorted onboard the\naircraft and introduced to the flight attendant.\nIf you so desire, Delta will make every effort to\nallow you to accompany your child onboard to see\nthat he is settled. However this is not always\npossible. We will attempt to seat your child where\nour flight attendants can give him their best\nattention (that is, in the front of the cabin, in a\nnon-smoking area and with other children who may\nalso be traveling alone).\nUp, Up, and Away\nAlthough our flight attendants try to give extra\nattention to unaccompanied minors, their onboard\nduties prevent them from entertaining the child\nfulltime. We suggest that your child bring along\na favorite toy, game, or book. A familiar plaything\nwill often add to his sense of security and make the\ntime without you pass quickly. It is a good idea to\nput your child's name on any item (including coats\nand jackets) that he brings onboard with him.\nDress your child in casual play clothes-simple,\nloose-fitting garments that he can nap and lounge\nin comfortably and manage easily when he uses"
