Each window designed\nas an emergency exit is clearly marked and can be opened by lifting the\ncover above it, pulling the red handle that is now exposed as far as it\nwill move, grasping the large transparent handle on the window and\npulling the window inwards. Leave the aircraft by stepping through the\nwindow on to the wing, one foot first followed by head and shoulders, and\nmove down the wing towards the rear, sliding off the end. If the window\nused is not over the wing, exercise caution as the drop to the ground\nmay be considerable. Do not attempt to take anything with you.\nESCAPE\nSLIDE\nAs the door is 8 feet above the ground, a canvas escape slide is provided\nto assist in rapid evacuation. It is stowed near the passanger entrance\ndoor and would normally be rigged and supervised by the Hostess. It is\nattached by four hooks to four rings around the door frame, two on the\nfloor and one on each side half way up. The lower end is thrown out of\nthe door and firmly held by the two pilots or able-bodied passengers\nstanding outside.\nESCAPE ROPES\nAn escape rope is provided near each door for use in leaving the aircraft\nin an emergency.\nEMERGENCY LANDING\nIn the possible event of an emergency, the Captain will announce\n\"Prepare for an emergency landing\".\nIn these circumstances please\nkeep calm and follow instructions from the crew.\nYour crew has\nundertaken regular specialised instruction and is well qualified to\ndeal with any emergency. The following general precautions should\nbe taken:-\n1.\nLoosen neckwear, remove glasses, dentures and high heeled\nshoes.\nFasten your seat belt tightly and stop smoking.\nNote the position of the emergency exists.\nJust prior to the landing grab your ankles and remain in this\nposition until the aircraft has come to rest.\n5.\nLeave the aircraft as directed by the Hostess and when\noutside stand well clear due to the risk of fire.\nCity Printers\nDOOR\nDOOR",
