Each window designed\nas an emergency exit is clearly marked and can be opened by lifting the\ncover above it, pulling the red handle that is now exposed as far as it\nwill move, grasping the large transparent handle on the window and\npulling the window inwards. Leave the aircraft by stepping through the\nwindow on to the wing, one foot first followed by head and shoulders, and\nmove down the wing towards the rear, sliding off the end. If the window\nused is not over the wing, exercise caution as the drop to the ground\nmay be considerable. Do not attempt to take anything with you.\nESCAPE\nSLIDE\nAs the door is 8 feet above the ground, a canvas escape slide is provided\nto assist in rapid evacuation. It is stowed near the passanger entrance\ndoor and would normally be rigged and supervised by the Hostess. It is\nattached by four hooks to four rings around the door frame, two on the\nfloor and one on each side half way up. The lower end is thrown out of\nthe door and firmly held by the two pilots or able-bodied passengers\nstanding outside.\nESCAPE ROPES\nAn escape rope is provided near each door for use in leaving the aircraft\nin an emergency.\nEMERGENCY LANDING\nIn the possible event of an emergency, the Captain will announce\n\"Prepare for an emergency landing\".\nIn these circumstances please\nkeep calm and follow instructions from the crew.\nYour crew has\nundertaken regular specialised instruction and is well qualified to\ndeal with any emergency. The following general precautions should\nbe taken:-\n1.\nLoosen neckwear, remove glasses, dentures and high heeled\nshoes.\nFasten your seat belt tightly and stop smoking.\nNote the position of the emergency exists.\nJust prior to the landing grab your ankles and remain in this\nposition until the aircraft has come to rest.\n5.\nLeave the aircraft as directed by the Hostess and when\noutside stand well clear due to the risk of fire.\nCity Printers\nDOOR\nDOOR",

Cigarettes only are permitted.\nseat belts: The seat belt must always be fastened during take-off and landing\nand occasionally when turbulent air conditions are encountered.\nAn illuminated\nsign will tell you when seat belts must be fastened; at other times it is wise to\nkeep them fastened unless it is inconvenient.\nhand baggage:\nApart from clothing and similar light articles, baggage must\nnot be placed on the racks as this may cause injury in turbulence.\nportable electronic equipment: Operation of\nportable radios or similar\nequipment is not allowed as this may interfere with electronic systems on the\naircraft.",
      "VISCOUNT VP.WAR, VP.WAS, VP.WAT, VP.YTE\nwindows:\nDOOR\nVISCOUNT VP.YNB, VP.YNC, VP.YND, VP.YNI\nwindows:\nDOOR\nEMERGENCY EXITS\nExit is normally via the main doors which may be opened by turning the\nhandle as indicated on the door; it is essential the trigger be firmly\ndepressed before attempting to turn the handle. Each window designed\nas an emergency exit is clearly marked and can be opened by lifting the\ncover above it, pulling the red handle that is now exposed as far as it\nwill move, grasping the large transparent handle on the window and\npulling the window inwards. Leave the aircraft by stepping through the\nwindow on to the wing, one foot first followed by head and shoulders, and\nmove down the wing towards the rear, sliding off the end. If the window\nused is not over the wing, exercise caution as the drop to the ground\nmay be considerable. Do not attempt to take anything with you.\nESCAPE\nSLIDE\nAs the door is 8 feet above the ground, a canvas escape slide is provided\nto assist in rapid evacuation. It is stowed near the passanger entrance\ndoor and would normally be rigged and supervised by the Hostess. It is\nattached by four hooks to four rings around the door frame, two on the\nfloor and one on each side half way up. The lower end is thrown out of\nthe door and firmly held by the two pilots or able-bodied passengers\nstanding outside.\nESCAPE ROPES\nAn escape rope is provided near each door for use in leaving the aircraft\nin an emergency.\nEMERGENCY LANDING\nIn the possible event of an emergency, the Captain will announce\n\"Prepare for an emergency landing\".\nIn these circumstances please\nkeep calm and follow instructions from the crew.\nYour crew has\nundertaken regular specialised instruction and is well qualified to\ndeal with any emergency. The following general precautions should\nbe taken:-\n1.\nLoosen neckwear, remove glasses, dentures and high heeled\nshoes.\nFasten your seat belt tightly and stop smoking.\nNote the position of the emergency exists.\nJust prior to the landing grab your ankles and remain in this\nposition until the aircraft has come to rest.\n5.\nLeave the aircraft as directed by the Hostess and when\noutside stand well clear due to the risk of fire.\nCity Printers\nDOOR\nDOOR"
