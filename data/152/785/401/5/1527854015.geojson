These transport links are\nprovided as part of the HK$155.3 billion Airport Core Programme.\nThe 24-hour airport will be user-friendly in every aspect. All essential facilities will be in one\nterminal building, with its internal shuttle train called an Automated People Mover, a network of\ntravelators and an efficient baggage handing system. Hong Kong Skymall has 30,000 square\nmeters of retail space, with more than 140 shops, food and beverage outlets, banks and money-\nclaneers.\nWith the first of two runways in operation, the new airport will be able to handle 35 million\npassengers and three million tonnes of air cargo annually. It will have 38 airbridge-served gates\nfor wide-bodied aircraft as well as 27 remote stands. On full development, the airport will be\nable to handle 87 million passengers and nine million tonnes of air cargo.\nThe stamps depict some of the key facilities and service supporting airport operations. They\nare: the passenger terminal's 2.5 kilometres of travelators ($1.30 stamp); the Automated People\nMover ($1.60 stamp); the Tsing Ma Bridge and Airport Railway ($2.50 stamp); the passenger\nterminal building and the new Airmail Centre ($2.60 stamp); the passenger terminal's frontal\naircraft gates ($3.10 stamp); and the departures level of the passenger terminal building ($5.00\nstamp).\nBAS BU\n1# Bundes Druckerei\namon\nFEW REPRI\n27.5 x 46₴*\nME 3E 0 7 :\n# 7L :\nRESE :\n3*15 0#8 :\n14\nSTAMP PRINTING DETAILS\nDesigner :\nBon KWAN\nPrinter :\nBundes Druckerei Gmbh,\nGermany\nProcess:\nStamp Size:\nLithography Stochastic\n27.5 × 46 mm\nStamp Sheet:\nPane of 25 stamps\nPerforation :\nPaper:\nUnwatermarked\nDate of Issue : 5 July 1998\nHongkong Post\n998.170.006",
