      "BECAUSE MORE PLANES ARE IN THE SKY\nMORE EXPRESS SPACE IS AVAILABLE\nYes, the flying machines are flying back. America\nhas achieved fantastic goals of plane production\nso the government has been releasing additional\nequipment to the airlines. This means that Air Ex-\npress has been able to hind more room for shipments\nthat didn't because of war-time space restrictions.\nMore planes mean more flights - and that means\nmore cargo. While much of the equipment released\nwill do double duty carrying both passengers and\ncargo. some of the planes will be used solely to\ntransport Air Mail and Air Express. And a single one\nor these sky giants can carry ooo pounds and over.\nFurther, larger and more powerful carriers are on\nthe drawing boards of aviation's designers.\nWhat about war cargo? Priority shipments still\ncome first; non-priority cargo is handled on a space-\navailable basis. But more space is available for all\nshipments - high, low, and non-priority.\nFact is, Air Express has played an important part\nin the war of production kor breakdowns and delaws\ncome when least expected. New parts are needed\nfast when a 24-hr. shift has to wait for an ailing\nmachine. Delivery dates get snarled up when\none forgets to figure the man-hour shortage.
