      "A word for your comfort\nfrom your captain...\nAir turbulence is occasionally encountered at jet\nflight levels with little advance warning. May I sug-\ngest you keep your seat belt fastened for the entire\nflight in the event we do encounter some unex-\npected bumpy air or turbulence. It will also be more\nconvenient if you plan to sleep since the stewardess\nwill not have to disturb you to determine if the belt\nis fastened when the sign is turned ON.\nPORTABLE RADIOS\nFrequency Modulated (FM) radio receivers may\nnot be operated while the aircraft is in flight. (All\nother portable receivers, and dictating devices, may\nbe used while the aircraft is in flight.) The reason\nFM radios cannot be used is that many of them\nhave circuits which radiate signals. These act like\nminiature broadcasting stations. In some cases,\nthese signals are strong enough to interfere with\nthe aircraft's navigation system and cause errone-\nous readings. In recognition of this fact, the Fed-\neral Aviation Agency (FAA) has issued a Special\nSafety Regulation. Portions of the regulation are\nquoted for your information:\n\"No person shall operate, nor shall any operator\nin command of any aircraft permit the operation\nof, a portable frequency modulated (FM) radio\nreceiver on ... aircraft operated by an air carrier\nor commercial operator.\"\nThank you for your cooperation.\nI hope you enjoy your trip.\n_ NORTHWEST ARLINES\nPF-70\nRev. 12-64",
