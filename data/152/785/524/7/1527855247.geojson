      "For\nYour Guidance\nA recent statement by the Civil Aeronautics\nBoard clarifies the position of the airlines in\nthe Nation's War Effort. There has been con-\nfusion on this subject, hence the CAB state-\nment released on May 22, 1942, is laid out\nbelow for vour information and guidance\nStatus of the Airlines\n\"The recent announcement by the War Depart-\nment made in connection with the President's\ndirective for a further coordination and integra-\nan of domestic air transportation with the\niies of the military service, illustrates the truth\nexpressed by the President on January 24, 1939,\nwhen he asserted that:\n'The countr's welfare in time of beace and\nils safety in time of war rests upon * * *\neconomically and technically sound air transporta-\nwon system.\n\"The President's recent directive contemplates\nthe transfer of a substantial portion of the avail.\nable flight equipment to Army air forces to be\noperaled by the varions services and commands of",
      "the Army; the conversion of a substantial number\nof ships into cargo carriers to be operated by air-\nline personnel under contract for the Air Service\nCommand; and the use of the remainder of the\nequipment (about one-balf of the present supply\nof the domestic lines) by the airlines in the con-\ntinuance of their regular scheduled operations;\nsubject to their availability for military missions in\nemergencies. Routes and schedules in airline oper\nation which are regarded as essential to the\nwar effort will be terminated to make possible the\nhighest utilization of the reduced equipment which\nis available to the airlines. Air travel vital to the\ncountry's needs will continue, subject to the\nenforcement of a strict system of briorities.\nAvailability of Serviee\n\"The facts as stated make clear the error in\nthe press reports of the last few days which\nannounced that operation of the airlines had\nbeen taken over by the War Department. While\nthe scheduled airline services have been limited pri-\nmarily to the war purposes and arrangements have\nbeen made for a closer adaptation of those services\nto the war needs, and while the number of schedules\nhave been substantially curtailed and in some in-\nstances routes suspended the airlines will continue\nto render service under their certificates of\npublic convenience and necessity and in accord-\nance with the regulatory authority of the Civil\nAeronautics Act. The whole-hearted fashion\nin which the air carriers have cooperated with\nthe military services in furtherance of the war\neffort bas made it possible for them to continue\noperating under private management ever\nthough they now constitute essentially an arm\nof the national defense.\n\"Thas, the CAB and its staff are assured that\ntheir work has become tied in more closely than\never before with the war effort. They have already\ntaken an active and major part in close cooperation\nwith the Military Director of Civil Aviation, in\nthe development and the plans for putting into\nearly effect the President's directive, and will con-\ntinue to discharge those regulatory functions pre-\nscribed by the Civil Aeronantics Act which are\neven more necessary in war than in peace.\" (Note-\nthe captions and bold italics are our own.)\nPlease note the following:\n1. The airlines continue to operate regu-\nlar schedules with equipment not\ntransferred to the\nArmy.\n2. Air travel vital to the country's needs\nwill continue, subject to the enforce-\nment ot priorities\n3. The airlines continue their operation\nas such and have not been taken over\nby the War Department.\nWhile the airlines \"now constitute essen-\ntally an arm of the national defense.\" and\nschedules have been set up to serve essential\ntraffic flow, space available will be reserved\non request subject to priority of national de-\nfense traffic movement.
