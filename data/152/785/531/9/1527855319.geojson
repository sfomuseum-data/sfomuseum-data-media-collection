CUSTOMS:\nthe rules are simple\nknowing them can ease you\nthrough inspections , fast!\nWhether you're homeward bound . . . or making\nyour first visit to the United States . . . there's\nno need to fear delay or inconvenience at the\ncustoms. There are rules, of course - but all of\nthem are sensible - and set up simply to protect\nthe United States, its citizens, and its visitors.\nBut since these rules are enforced without ex-\nception, we thought you'd like to look over the\nones that affect you ... plus some hints to speed\nyou through customs.\nFor instance, it's faster to pack dutiable items\ntogether. It's easier to list each one as you pack\nit. It's safer to check your final list with your sales\nslips see that everything is listed correctly.\nThen you have only to copy this list on the U.S.\nCustoms declaration form - which you will be\ngiven by your purser aboard the Clipper - with\nease and speed.\nOf course, traveling by Pan American \"Clipper\"\nyou're at your destination before there's any need\nto disturb that final packing - and you avoid the\nhavoc which would result from having to live out\nof your luggage en route.\nWhen you land at the U.S. Port of Entry, there\nare several questions you'll have to answer: How\nlong you ve been gone trom the country\nwhat you acquired on your trip.\n. what you\nhave to declare.\nAnd your answers are important! An uninten-\ntional error or omission can cause you consider\nable inconvenience . : . and misrepresentation\ncan result in loss of your free-entry privileges or\nin some cases, confiscation of your belongings.\nWe think you'll find these suggestions an aid to\na more pleasant trip. And you can count on their\naccuracy . . . the United States\nGovernment\nsupplied us with its latest regulations.\nwhat every returni\nU. S. resident\nshould know\nIf you're a U.S. resident, your Uncle Sam gives\nyou certain privileges as a returing tourist. For\ninstance, you don't have to pay duty on many\narticles you buy abroad. But that doesn't mean\nyou can just cram your suitcases and cruise\nthrough the customs. There are declarations to\nmake. There are time limits to watch. And there's\nthe matter of what an article is worth. You'll find\nmost of these rules explained below.\nWELL I DECLARE.\nYou'll have to declare in writing anything ac-\nquired abroad which (1) you are bringing in for\nsomeone else at that person's request; (2) you\nintend to sell or use in business; (3) you\nbringing home for personal or household use or\nas a souvenir or curio; (4) all alterations and any\nrepairs to articles taken abroad, other than nec-\nessary repairs to restore an article to the condition\nit was in when taken abroad.\nBut what about gifts or other articles you've\nsent on home ahead of your arrival . .. or ar-\nranged to have shipped later? To include such\narticles under exemptions, you must declare them\nwith the rest.",
