Everything considered, Site No. 5 is as windy as\nSites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 and Site No. 2 is even more so. The least\naverage wind velocity and the greatest freedon from high winds\nwere found at Site No. 3.\nAlthough the lightest average winds and greatest freedom\nfrom high wind velocities were found at Site No. 3, the winds\nthere were very gusty, decidedly more so than at any of the other\nsuggested sites. Gustiness was greater at Site No. 2 than at any\nof the others with the exception of Site No. 3 and there was little\ndifference between Sites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 and Site No. 5, the latter\nhaving a slight advantage.\nInvestigation of turbulence in the first 1000 feet above the\nground revealed practically identical conditions at Site No. 3\nand Site No. 6, and less favorable conditions over the other\nproposed locations.\nPrecipitation and Temperature.\nPrecipitation, the one remaining meteorological element\nfor which comparative data were obtained, did not vary between",
