      "Wind velocity, gustiness and turbulence.\nConsidering the entire period of observation, the greatest\naverage wind velocity occurred at Site No. 2, with Site No. 5,\nSites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 and Site No. 5 following in order.\nThe\nprevailing winds blew with greater average velocity at both\nSite No. 2 and Site No. 5 than at Sites Nos. 1, 4 and 6, but ex-\ntreme velocities of 30, 35 and 40 miles per hour or more were\nrecorded a greater number of times at Sites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 than\nat Site No. 5. Everything considered, Site No. 5 is as windy as\nSites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 and Site No. 2 is even more so. The least\naverage wind velocity and the greatest freedon from high winds\nwere found at Site No. 3.\nAlthough the lightest average winds and greatest freedom\nfrom high wind velocities were found at Site No. 3, the winds\nthere were very gusty, decidedly more so than at any of the other\nsuggested sites. Gustiness was greater at Site No. 2 than at any\nof the others with the exception of Site No. 3 and there was little\ndifference between Sites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 and Site No. 5, the latter\nhaving a slight advantage.\nInvestigation of turbulence in the first 1000 feet above the\nground revealed practically identical conditions at Site No. 3\nand Site No. 6, and less favorable conditions over the other\nproposed locations.\nPrecipitation and Temperature.\nPrecipitation, the one remaining meteorological element\nfor which comparative data were obtained, did not vary between",
      "the several proposed sites by any considerable amount. Neither\nthe precipitation data in Table 19 nor the temperature data in\nTable 20 have any important bearing on airport location within\nthe area under consideration but they will be found to have\nother practical applications.\nConditions Summarized.\nFrom the consideration of data that have been presented,\nit is obvious that Site No. 6 (Mills Field)* has an advantage\nover all other proposed sites in freedom from fog, visability, ceil-\ning, and constancy of wind direction.\nMoreover, the prevailing\nwind direction at Site No. 6 (Mills Field*) is such that the majority\nof take-offs may be made over favorable territory, which cannot be\nsaid for any other proposed site, excepting No. 4 (adjoining and to\nthe south of Mills Field*). In fact, departures may be made in any\ndirection from Site No. 6 (M111s Field*) with favorable conditions\nfor an emergency landing in the proximity of the airport should\noccasion require it.\nIt was also found that the variation in wind direction from\nmoment to moment at Site No. 6 (Mills Field*) was less than at any\nother proposed site except No. 2 (South San Francisco*). The surface\nwind velocity at Site No. 6 (Mills Field) was found to be more\n(South s.F.*)\nadvantageous for the operation of aircraft than at Site No. 2/and\nequally with Site No. 5 (Pt. San Mateo*), although smaller average\nwind velocities and greater freedom from high winds occurred at\nSite No. 3 (Beresford*). The latter site, however, has a distinct\ndisadvantage on account of excessive gustiness, an evil from\nwhich x\u0026 Site No. 6 (Mills Field) is relatively free.\nNo other pro-\nposed site had less turbulence in the lower levels of the air than\nSite No. 6 (Mills Piela)* while, above 1000 feet, smather air was\nNOTE: *Words in parenthesis do not occur in text.",
