Kent\nchairmen of the Airport Committee,\nBoard of Supervisors,\nGary or San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\nsir:\nInasmuch as the Chairmen of the advisory Committee on\nAviation to the City of San Francisco, is leaving on a trip to\nEurope, which will consume at least two months time, a meeting of\nthe Advisory Committee was held on this date, in order that this\nreport could be furnished to you of the unanimous sentiment, feel-\nings and recommendations of the Advisory Conmittee.\nIn case you, or the Board of supervisors, find it\nnecessary to possess any further details regarding the attitude\nof this (\nCommittee, during my absence, you can call upon Lieutenant-\nColonel Gerald\nthe Committee,\nC. Brant, or B. B.\nMouton.\nfor siren information.\nthe other members of\nThere 1s no divergence of\nopinion among the members of this committee, and any statement or\nrecommendations they may make can be considered as naving my\nheartiest endorsement and approval.\nOn March 26th last, Mr. Mershall Hale, President of the\nDown Town Association, stated that he had recommended me, as Chair-\nof the Aviation Committee :\nof the Down Town Association,\nto be\na member of the advisory Committee on Aviation, to be appointed by\nthe Mayor.\nOn April 8th last, I read in the newspapers that such\ncommittee had been appointed, consisting of Lieutenent-Colonel\nGerald C. Brant and B. E. Mouton and myself , but that vou had ex-\npressed some uncertainty as co the possibility of securing Colonel\nBrant, or Mr. Mouton, because of their federal connections.\ncalled you on the telephone several times between that date and\nthe date of the first meeting of\nand was informed by\nnot yet been definitely determined, because of War Department object-\nlons to the service of colonel Brant on the committee.\nWhen our Advisory Committee finally did meet with your\nAirport Committee in joint conference, on May 3, 1929, at the Palace\nHotel, the entire situation was informally discussed.\nThe members\nof our Committee were in agreement with the facts presented by you\nthat Mills Field, if properly developed, would make a satisfactory\naviation base (as distinguished from aviation terminal).\nthat time showed us meteorological date, and other information, which\ntended to\nmorove\nsix available\nthat Mills Field was the most satisfactory the\nsites in the environs of San Francisco which had been",
      "suggested as municipal airports.\nAll of the members of our Advisory\nCommittee had previously visited and inspected Mills Field, and two\nthe members, Colonel Brant and B. B. Mouton, had flom there\nOR\nmany occasions and were of the belief that many of the arguments\nadvanced by opponents of the field had their origin in the fact that\nthe fleld was only partially developed and was not due to any in-\nherent faults in the field itself.\nwas satisfactory as an airport base\nHe all felt that the location\n,and that, with the addition\nof more land; the additional drainage of a large portion of the\nproposed augmented field; the construction of proper runways and\nsatisfactory hangar space; satisfactory flood lighting for night\nlandings, and other improvements, the field would be a first-class\nairport.\nAt this first meeting, however, Ir. Mouton earnestly\nsuggested that immediate steps be taken to secure definite knowledge\nas to the possibilities of immediate vesting of title in the City\nfor the land occupied by Mills Fleld.\nBoth Colonel Brant and my-\nself vigorously supported Ir. Mouton and stated that\nas a citizens Advisory Committee, recommend that money be expended\nfor permanent improvements until me were certain that the field\ncould, either by purchase or by proper and legal condemnation, be\nsecured for the City within the very immediate future.\nYou there-\nцооД\nassured us that a gentleman's agreement had been entered into\nwith Mr. Mills whereby it was assured that purchase of the field\nwould be possible as soon as the City of San Francisco secured the\nnecessary money.\nThe study, subsequent action and recommendations\nof this Committee, have been based upon this understanding that the\nfield could be purchased by the City and that any expenditures\nwould not be wasted on property to which the City of Sen Franoisco\ncould never have title.\nSubsequent to the meeting of Mey 3rd, our Committee en-\ngaged in correspondence and consultation with various experts re-\ngarding the situation at Mills Field, but held no further meetings\nwith your Airport Comittee of the Board of Supervisors, unt1l\nyour cal 1 for a second meeting.\nThis meeting was held on July 10th\nat the Palace Hotel.\nAt this meeting the question of purchasing\nthe airport, or condemning it, was again the principal question\nfor discussion.\nColonel Brant suggested his willingness to\ntouch with Mr. Mills, through P.\nTrubee Davidson, Assistant Secre-\ntary of War; and I suggested my willingness to get in touch with\nhim, and you gave us assurance that the matter was being negotiated.\nYou then presented for the consideration of the Advisory\nCommittee a file, No. 531.14, called \"Budget Items - 1929-1930*\nin which the budget requirements of Mills Fleld for the current year\nare set forth.\nThese budget items were set forth under three\nCATA.\ncOme",
      "Items most essential\nEssential items\n(3)\nThe total of \"Items most essential\" was $602,260; the total\nof \"Essential items\" was\n§243, 770,\nand the toeil or\n\"Desirable\nitems\" was 52,645, making a grand total of $898,675.00. In the\n\"Loems most essential\" was included $411,000 for the purchase of\n1595 acres of reclaimed land and tidelends, which would constitute\nthe expanded area of Mills Field; and other Items were included of\na ре манеть maures\nIn discussing this budget progren, our Committee took the\nstand that with the small appropriation available for the airport\nduring the current year\nother parties than the dity, and with the title still remaining in\nit would only be advisable to\nsuon moneys\n88\nwere necessary for keeping the field in flying\ncondition and for operating the seme.\nOur Committee realized that\nthere are certain tenants\nwho must be kept\nat Mills Field who\nsatisfied, and we\nare paying rents and\nrealized that so much money had\nalreedy been out into the field that the investment could not be\njeopardized by allowing it to deteriorate so that flying conditions\nwould be made hazardous or unreliable.\ntherefore,\nfelt that\nany expenditures approved by us should be iimited to strictly\nnon-permanent expenditures, which were necessary for the operation\nand maincenance of the melon\nUpon your assurance that the field could be purchased,\nalso approved certain other minor items\nwe\nof a permanent nature which\nbe properly improved.\nHowever, no items in the second and third categories, 1. e. \"Essen-\ntial items\" and \"Desirable items\" were approved.\nBefore the meeting of July 10th adjourned, I asked you if\nit would interfere with your plans if I got in touch with Mr. Mills\nand found out his attitude toward the sale of this land.\ned you thought this would be very helpful.\nYou stat-\nI explained to you that\nour committee wanted a definite statement of the attitude of Mr.\nMills toward the disposition of this property.\nImmediately after this meeting I left on my vacation and did\nnot return for some two or three weeks, but upon my return I wrote\nto Mr. Ogden L. Mills, under date of August 2ist, as follows:\nHon.\nOgden Mills\nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury\nWashington, D.

Brant,\nField,\nCommonder of Crissy\nand 3.\nMouton, Aeronautical Inspector for\nthe Department o1 commerce, are the other members of\nmy Committee.\nWe have held several meetings and it is the\nconsensus of opinion of our Advisory Cormittee that\nthe city of San Francisco needs a really good municipal\nairport.\nIn spite of adverse criticisms of Ills\nField, we, who are all practical flyers, feel that\nWills Field con be developed eventually into a Class\nA airport, if sufficient money is spent upon it by the\nCity of San Frencisco.\nHowever, we naturally feel that\nthe City cannot spend a great sum of monev on this\nfield until title is vested in the City of Sen Francisco.\nAlready, certain of the Supervisors are trying to make\na political football out of\nresult will\nthis issue and the only\nbe to retard the development of a first-\nclass earport for our city.\nI am writing to you because I feel that the\nperpetuation of the memory of your father in the name\n\"Idlls Field\"\nthe City of\nSen Fran-\ncisco, are both matters of great interest and concern\nto you.\nI feel that it would be much better to purchase the\nproperty from you directly, then to attempt to\ncondemn it for City purposes, as was recently suggested\nby one of the Supern sors.\nI feel that you have a\nsplendid opportunity to gain the affection and good will\nof the citizens of Son Francisco by maling us a liberal\noffer for the purchase of this property, and I feel\nthat if such an offer is made by you that the transaction\ncan be quickLy consumated.\nI am writing this frankly to you because I\nfeel the situation should not be allowed to dras.on, but",

      "-6-\nnot in a position to rake a generous gesture, nor\nis my Aunt, Is.
