Mouton, had flom there\nOR\nmany occasions and were of the belief that many of the arguments\nadvanced by opponents of the field had their origin in the fact that\nthe fleld was only partially developed and was not due to any in-\nherent faults in the field itself.\nwas satisfactory as an airport base\nHe all felt that the location\n,and that, with the addition\nof more land; the additional drainage of a large portion of the\nproposed augmented field; the construction of proper runways and\nsatisfactory hangar space; satisfactory flood lighting for night\nlandings, and other improvements, the field would be a first-class\nairport.\nAt this first meeting, however, Ir. Mouton earnestly\nsuggested that immediate steps be taken to secure definite knowledge\nas to the possibilities of immediate vesting of title in the City\nfor the land occupied by Mills Fleld.\nBoth Colonel Brant and my-\nself vigorously supported Ir. Mouton and stated that\nas a citizens Advisory Committee, recommend that money be expended\nfor permanent improvements until me were certain that the field\ncould, either by purchase or by proper and legal condemnation, be\nsecured for the City within the very immediate future.\nYou there-\nцооД\nassured us that a gentleman's agreement had been entered into\nwith Mr. Mills whereby it was assured that purchase of the field\nwould be possible as soon as the City of San Francisco secured the\nnecessary money.\nThe study, subsequent action and recommendations\nof this Committee, have been based upon this understanding that the\nfield could be purchased by the City and that any expenditures\nwould not be wasted on property to which the City of Sen Franoisco\ncould never have title.\nSubsequent to the meeting of Mey 3rd, our Committee en-\ngaged in correspondence and consultation with various experts re-\ngarding the situation at Mills Field, but held no further meetings\nwith your Airport Comittee of the Board of Supervisors, unt1l\nyour cal 1 for a second meeting.\nThis meeting was held on July 10th\nat the Palace Hotel.\nAt this meeting the question of purchasing\nthe airport, or condemning it, was again the principal question\nfor discussion.\nColonel Brant suggested his willingness to\ntouch with Mr. Mills, through P.\nTrubee Davidson, Assistant Secre-\ntary of War; and I suggested my willingness to get in touch with\nhim, and you gave us assurance that the matter was being negotiated.\nYou then presented for the consideration of the Advisory\nCommittee a file, No. 531.14, called \"Budget Items - 1929-1930*\nin which the budget requirements of Mills Fleld for the current year\nare set forth.\nThese budget items were set forth under three\nCATA.\ncOme",
