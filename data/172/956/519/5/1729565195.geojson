In other words,\nif you fly East you shorten your hours of daylight, and alternatively.\nflying West, you are tending to \"keep up with\" the sun and so\nlengthen your daylight hours.\nTo keep your watches in synchronisation with the daylight, it is\nnecessary to make the following corrections:\nNORTHBOUND\nBetween Sydney and Fiji add\n? hours.\nBetween Fiji and Canton Is.\nadd hour less day.\nBetween Canton Is. and Hono-\nlulu add 1 hour.\nRetween\nHonolulu andl\nFrancisco add 2 hours.\nBetween\nSan Francisco and\nVancouver add nil.\nBetween Auckland and Fili add\nSOUTHBOUND\nBetween Vancouver\nand San\nFrancisco subtract nil.\nBetween\nSan Francisco and\nHonolulu subtract 2 hours.\nRetween Honolut and Canton.\nIs. subtract I hour.\nBetween\nCanton Is. and Fill\nsubtract | hour (plus 1 day).\nBetween Fiji and Sydney sub-\ntract 2 houre\nFiff and Auckland\nsubtract nill\nTUR INTEDNATIONAI DATE LINS\nThe ta ten Date fine was crosted to standardise the com.\nmencing and finishing point of a calendar day.

C. P. T. Ulm. H. w\nLyon and J. Warner. On May 31, 1928,\nthe \"Southern Cross\" took off trom Oak.\nland, California, on the first stage of the\nrecord flight to Brisbane, Australia. 27\nhours later, Kingsford Smith made a per-\ntect landina at Hawall. As soon as the\n\"Southern Cross\" was refuelled and the crew rested. the second stage\n3,128 trackless miles to Fiji, was begun. Despite instrument trouble,\nthe \"Southern Cross\" landed at Fiji 34 hours later. The flight from Fift\nto Brisbane was made through tropical storms, necessitating much\ninstrument flying. However, on June 9, after a total of 82 hours 42\nminutes in the air, the \"Southern Cross,\" the first aircraft to negotiate\nthe 7.000 miles across the Pacific. touched down a+ Brisbane.\nIt is interesting to compare the performance of the \"Southern\nCan\"with that a BORA'S DC…h Airlinere\nWingspan\nCruisina soeed\nNumber of engines\nTotal horsepower\nAll-up weight\nElvina time\nacross the Pacific\nPersons carried\nAverage altitude\n\"Southern Cross\"\n71 ft. 8f ins.\n85 m.ohl\nDC-6\n117 ft. 6 ins.\n300 m.n.h\n660\n1,300 gallons\n7 tons\n8 hrs. 47 mins.\n9,600\n4,240 gallons\n414 tons\n29l hrs.\n1.000 f\n18.000 ft.\nFor the interest and information of passengers, three instru-\nments are situated above the madazine racks. near the cloak.\nCLOCK:\nShowing accurate Local Time.\nAIRSPEED INDICATOR:\nThis instrument shows the Indicated Airspeed .A.S. or the\naircraft and is calibrated to a standard condition of pressure\nsuch\nexperienced at height, necessitate corrections to the I.A.S. to\nobtain the True Airsheed TA.S.\nThe corrections. ton\napplied are shown on a scale beside the instrument.
