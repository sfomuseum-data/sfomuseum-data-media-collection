      "SWA Travi Tips mops, and the air European\nabout 8 major European\ncountries are available at 50¬¢ each, a set of any three\nat $1.00, and all eight for $2.50.\nAny TWA representative will be glad to answer your\nquestions and give you information on sightseeing and\nshopping.

On flights within the U.S., the rule is: you must\nreconfirm at least 6 hours before departure time at each\nstopover city. You can reconfirm your continuing reser-\nvations at the TWA airport ticket counter on arrival,\nor by telephoning the city TWA office.\nSome Do's and Don'ts\nAmy Vanderbilt, the etiquette authority, has given us\nthe following suggestions on \"plane manners.\"\nDo's\n1. When traveling alone, do give up a double seat so\nthat a couple may sit together.\n2. Do adjust the air vent so it is not directly in the\nface of your seat mate.\n3. Do keep children occupied with books, games,\nconversation.\n4. Do feel free to remove your shoes for greater com-\nfort when sleeping.\n5. Do ask for information about the area you are\nflying over if it is of interest to you.\n6. Do ask your Hostess to warm the baby's bottle.\n7. During evening flights, do try to keep your voice\nlow, as others may be sleeping.\n8. Feel free to talk to fellow passengers. This is so-\ncially correct among plane passengers.\n9. Since yawning and chewing gum relieve pressure,\nthey are perfectly acceptable in plane travel.\n10. When leaving the airplane, do put your seat in\nerect position so that people behind you can get\nout easily.\nDon'ts\n1. Don't forget to check before leaving the plane to\nmake sure you have all your belongings.\n2. Don't hesitate to chat with your Hostess or Purser\nduring their free moments.\n3. Don't forget to use your \"Seat Occupied\" card if\nyou leave the plane to stroll around at an inter-\nmediate stop.\n4. Don't hesitate to get off the plane at stops to have\na look around. You won't get lost, and there will\nbe an announcement in the terminal to give you\nplenty of time to return to your seat.\n5. Don't lower your seat without first checking be-\nhind you. It may jolt your neighbor's lap tray.\n6. On arrival at your destination, don't leave your\nseat until the engines have come to a full stop.\n7. Don't forget to return magazines and newspapers\nwhen you are finished so that others may enjoy\nthem.\n8. Don't park hand luggage in the aisle or in your\nneighbor's way.\n9. Don't be reluctant about fastening your napkin\n(it has a buttonhole) to your shirt or blouse-the\n\"napkin under the chin\" look is popular on planes.\n10. Don't hesitate to tell your Hostess this is your first\nflight. She'll be glad to point things out to you.\nIf you're interested in any of the following leaflets, just\ncheck the ones you want and send your request to me.\nLet's Talk About...\nClimates and Clothes\nShopping Abroad\nTipping Abroad\nTraveling Solo\nTraveling with Tots\nStretching Your Travel Dollar\nNew York\nCalifornia\nCurrency Converter\nBasic Travel Wardrobes\n0000000000\nAll set for your first flight?
