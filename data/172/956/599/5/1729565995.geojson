      "YOUR\nFIRST\nFLIGHT\nI'm very glad you're planning to join the more\nthan five million people who fly\nTWA each year!\nThere's just nothing like air travel to get you where\nyou're going swiftly, comfortably, and conveniently. It\nenables you to make the most of your vacation time ...\nsee more of your family and friends... get more done\non business trips.\nYou've probably been wondering just what it's like to\ntravel by air, and exactly what you can expect on your\nfirst flight. Suppose I describe a typical TWA flight for\nyou. Let's say you're about to take off for Europe, or on\na trip in the U.S. Your bags are packed, your reserva-\ntions confirmed, and you're ready and eager to go! Be\nsure you know what time you have to be at the ticket\ncounter, and get there in plenty of time.\nCheck-In Time\nFirst you \"check in\" for your flight by taking your\nticket and baggage to the agent at the downtown or\nairport ticket counter. He'll tear a coupon off and put\nyour flight number on the envelope. Show this envelope\nto your Hostess when you board your plane.\nIf you're travelling on TWA Constellations\nor Jet-\nstreams First Class, you may select your seat on the\nplane from a seating plan when you check in at the\nticket counter. On Tourist or Coach flights the rule is\nfirst come, first served - select your seat after you've\nstepped aboard the plane. Preferences about seats differ;\nto look out of the window choose a seat in the rear\nof the plane.\nAt the airport, listen for a departure announcement.\nThe announcement will give your flight number and\ndestination city and will tell you which gate to go to.\nA Word About Your Baggage\nYour baggage will be tagged at the ticket counter,\nand will be checked through to your destination when\nvou check in at the downtown or airport counter. It\nwill be waiting for you to pick up in the baggage arrival\narea at the airport when you arrive on flights within\nthe U.S.. or at the international customs counter on\nflights overseas.\nWhen you're packing, be sure to keep in mind your\nfree baggage allowance: 40 Ibs. on flights within the\nU. S., 66 Ibs. on international First Class flights, and 44\nIbs. on international Tourist and Economy Class flights.\nTo avoid excess baggage charges, it's a good idea to\nweigh your baggage on the bathroom\nscale before\nyou go.\nIf you must have excess baggage, the charge is 1% of\nthe First Class adult one-way fare per kilogram (2.2 lbs.)\non international flights, and one-half of 1% of the adult\nFirst Class one-way fare per pound on flights in the\nU.S. These charges apply for ali classes of service.\nYour coat, umbrella, pocketbook, magazines and books,\nand small cameras do not count as baggage, and you\nmay carry them aboard your plane without having them\nweighed.\nYour Hostess will take care of your coat\nWelcome Aboard!\nBefore taking off, and again before landing, you\nwill be asked to fasten your seat belt, and the\nSmoking\" sign will flash on. At all other times when\nthe plane is in the air, you may smoke as many ciga-\nrettes as you want.\nOut of consideration for all the\npassengers, cigar and pipe smoking is discouraged on\nThe Hostess will offer you chewing gum before you\ntake off. Chewing or yawning helps to relieve air pres-\nsure changes.\nYou can draw the window curtains to cut off light, if\nyou wish. Your Hostess will remove the center arm of\nthe seat, if you have no seat companion, so you can\nstretch out more freely. There is an overhead rack for\nyour hat, and a handy push button for your individual\nRelax-and enjoy your flight! You'll find it easy to ad-\nreclining armchair to the angle at\nwhich you're most comfortable, using a convenient\nlever on the arm of your seat. Watch the scenery below\nthrough the big picture windows. And when you get\ntired of sitting in one place, get up and stretch your legs\n-it's perfectly all right to stroll up and down the aisle.\nOn First Class flights, you're welcome to go to the\nYou'll find a drinking fountain located near the door\nof the plane. and several lavatories\non hoard each\ncomplete with well-lighted mirrors for prettying up, and\nsupplied with soap and cleansing tissues for your use.\nBy all means explore the plane-but we have to call the\nflight deck or cockpit up forward out of bounds. Gov-\nernment regulations require us to reserve this working\narea for your flight crew. Here they control all the pre-\ncision instruments necessary in flying your giant Sky-\nliner, including the up-to-the-minute radar equipment\nthat assures you a smooth, comfortable flight.\nHave You A\nQuestion?\nFrom time to time your Captain or Hostess may\ngive you information over the loud-speaker system\nabout where you are, how high you are flying, and how\nfast you are traveling.\nThere are some special sounds you may wonder about.\nAn intermittent sound during take-offs and landings\n(rather like a giant buzzer) comes from special hy-\ndraulic motors that operate wing flaps and landing gear.\nIf you hear a tone change from the engines, it's your\npilot adjusting the propellers to take a larger or smaller\n'bite\" of air. At night you may see\nescaping exhaust\ngases-orange and red, which are visible in the dark.\nYou'll Enjoy\nReal Comfort..\nIf there's anything you want, just push the over-\nhead button to summon your Hostess. She'll be glad to\nbring you a pillow or a blanket, one of the many current\nmagazines carried on board, or a writing kit. Why not\ntake advantage of this opportunity to write some picture\npostcards (they're free!) which your Hostess will be\nhappy to mail for you? Your Hostess will also provide\ngotles to amuse the youngsters, and warm the baby's\nWould you like some cool, fresh air? Your Hostess\nwill show you the little air vent, located above your\nhead, which you can easily adjust.\n... and Wonderful Food!\nOn all First Class TWA flights within the U.S.\nand overseas, you enjoy delicious, hot full-course meals\nserved right at your seat-at no extra cost! On coach\nflights in the U.S. there is a nominal charge for meals;\non international flights there's no charge. Tea, coffee,\nand milk are available at all times. And remember-one\nof the wonderful things about air travel - there's no\ntipping at any time!\nOn TWA Super-G Constellations and Jetstreams there's\na gleaming galley to delight the housewife in every\nwoman-it's complete with the very latest in refrigera-\ntors and electric in-flight ovens. Your entrée is served\nhot-imagine that 18.000 feet in the air!\nUpon Arrival In Europe\nAir travel is so swift and pleasant that you'll be\nacross the\nAtlantic before you know it! When you\nland, a TWA ground Hostess will welcome you at the\nairport and, if\nyou wish, help you through customs\nand any other formalities. Don't worry about foreign\nlanguages-your ground Hostess is a trained linguist.\nIf you need help in finding your way about foreign\ncities, stop in at the local TWA office. They'll gladly",
