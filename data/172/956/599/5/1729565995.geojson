Do ask for information about the area you are\nflying over if it is of interest to you.\n6. Do ask your Hostess to warm the baby's bottle.\n7. During evening flights, do try to keep your voice\nlow, as others may be sleeping\n8. Feel free to talk to fellow passengers. This is so-\ncially correct among plane passengers.\n9. Since yawning and chewing gum relieve pressure,\nhey are perecry acceptable in plane travel.\n10.

Don't forget to check before leaving the plane to\nmake sure you have all your belongings.\n2. Don't hesitate to chat with your Hostess or Purser\nduring their tree moments\n3.
