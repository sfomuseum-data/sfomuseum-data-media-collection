      "Twenty Years of\nResearch, Service,\nDependability...\nTWA's History\nWhen a group of already established airlines were merged in 1930 to\nform TWA, airlines as we know them now were in their infancy. But\neven then, TWA was more than just an operator of airplanes carrying\npassengers across the United States. TWA management was already laying\nplans for better planes, for more reliable instruments, for better weather\nanalysis, for better things for commercial aviation. They had started the\npioneering which has blazed a trail second to none in the airline industry.\nThe search for better aircraft bore fruit early. TWA engineers, in co-\noperation with the Douglas Aircraft Corporation, evolved the design and\nspecifications which led first to the DC-1 and then to the DC-2 which was,\nof course, the forerunner of the DC-3 and the Douglas Skymaster-today's\ndependable \"workhorses of the airways.\"\nRecognizing the need for a faster, larger, more comfortable airplane\nthat could fly over the weather at high altitudes, TWA executives and\nengineers helped develop the first 4-engine high-altitude plane used in\ncommercial service... the famous Boeing Stratoliner. But great as the\nadvance of the Stratoliner was, an even greater advance for aviation was\nto follow... and again the result of bold vision by TWA men. In 1944, the\ncollective skill and talent of TWA and Lockheed technicians produced\nthe now-famous \"Constellation\"-the airplane which gave the public and\nthe world's airlines a brand new set of standards for fast, luxury air travel.\nBut TWA's present position of leadership in world aviation was built\non many, many factors beside aircraft design and development. In its\nceaseless search for comfort and dependability, TWA has developed new\ninstruments, new weather data, new maintenance skills...yes, even new\nways to cook foods. Here are just a few examples of TWA's aviation\npioneering.\nTWA carried passengers entirely by air in scheduled service across\nthe U.S.A. before any other airline, and operated 4-engine land\nplanes over-ocean on regular schedules. It was TWA that first devel-\noped and used pressurized cabins for \"over-weather\" flying. De-icers,\nautomatic pilots, the use of wing flaps as \"air brakes\" and the use\nof radar for a commercial airline were also pioneered by WA. As\npart of TWA's careful flight planning, staff\nmeteorologists were\nemployed, a written flight plan was required for every flight, and\nexperienced pilots were used as Flight Dispatchers to handle flights\nfrom ground control. TWA's foresight and planning, research and\nengineering have always been directed toward bringing the traveling\npublic the finest, most modern equipment, offering the greatest\nsecurity and comfort to the passenger.\nTWA\nTRANS WORLD AIRLINES",
      "Seat Belt Fastened?\nBaby Traveling\nWith You?\nThe rules require using\nyour seat belt. The captain's\nsign will tell you when. Fas-\nten your seat belt when the\nsign flashes on above the\ndoor in the front of the\nplane; when it goes off, you\ncan loosen it.\nSmoking?\nYour hostess has a limited\nsupply of such baby items\nas safety pins, diapers,\nstrained foods, which she\nwill be glad to provide on\nrequest. She is not per-\nmitted to mix formulas, but\nwill be glad to heat your\nbottles at feeding time.\nEars Closed Up?\nNot in or near the plane\nwhen it's on the ground,\nand not in the air when the\npilot's sign flashes \"No\nSmoking.\nOtherwise,\nsmoke as much as you\nplease, using the ash trays\non the arm of your seat and\nnear the window. Only cig-\narettes, please.\nToo Hot\nor Too Cold?\nAs the plane varies altitude,\nespecially when getting\nready for a landing, the\npressure on your inner and\nouter ears may become un-\nequal. A healthy yawn will\noften equalize the pressure\nand clear your ears; chew-\ning gum is also a help.\nLike to\nFreshen Up?\nIn the rack overhead are\npillows and blankets which\nyour hostess will be glad to\nhand you at any time, if you\nneed them. She also watches\nthe temperature and ven-\ntilation very closely, but if\nyou should\nbe uncomfort-\nable, just ring for her.\nThe Team on the Ground\nLike an iceberg with nine-tenths of its bulk hidden beneath the water,\nmost of TWA's personnel are not seen by the flying public. In fact, for\nevery TWA crew member in the air, there are 9 TWA men and women\non the ground. They include maintenance mechanics, station mana-\ngers, ground radio men, aeronautical engineers, radio engineers, mete-\norologists and many, many others. There are more than 2,800 highly\nskilled TWA employees in maintenance alone.\nThese maintenance\npeople and other TWA personnel on the ground all over the world work\ntogether like a smoothly-oiled machine with one common goal...to\nspeed you to your destination quickly, dependably and comfortably.\nThere are lavatory facilities\nin the rear of the cabin, for\nboth men and women, com\nplete with all the comforts\nand conveniences of home.\nPlease, no smoking in the\nlavatories at any time. This\nis most important!",
