      "Historio Fired Flaghts of Dan American Elepress\nDan Sovrican Clipper Canettesson arcines our Tokyo\nafer flying 5, 178 miles nonstop from Las Angeles,\nApril 25, 1976\nLos Angeles to Tokyo nonstop service is inaugurated by Pan Am's Clipper Constitution N532PA, comman\nded by Captain Jake M. Marcum. Flying time: 11 hours, 44 minutes.\nThe following day the Clipper Freedom N531PA, under the command of Captain James Neil King, flies non\nstop from New York to Tokyo - a distance of 6,916 miles - in 13 hours, 40 minutes.\nThe two record-breaking inaugural flights marked the first use of Pan Am's new Boeing B747SP (Special\nPerformance) jetliner. Forty seven feet shorter than the regular B747, it has the longest range of any commercial\naircraft. Many routes that previously required a fuel stop are now flown nonstop by Pan Am's fleet of B747SPs.\nAbout the Artist\nIn 1926, John T. McCoy became a working student for the Curtiss Flying Ser\nvice, Curtiss Field, Long Island, New York.\nWhen Charles A. Lindbergh arrived at Curtiss Field, his SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS\nwas housed in one of the Curtiss hangars. It was at this time that McCoy met\nLindbergh, who was most cordial and friendly to those who worked on the flight\nline. In those days muscle power was the method used for starting engines, ac\ncomplished by swinging the propeller by hand. McCoy often pulled a prop through\nfor Lindbergh.\nYears later, when McCoy was commissioned to do paintings depicting the\nhistory of Pan American World Airways, Inc. - entitled HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHTS\nOF PAN AMERICAN CLIPPERS - he consulted with Lindbergh on the selection of\naircraft and locations for the series.\nThis is one picture in a series of thirteen. If you would like to purchase 8½\" × 11'\nor 16* × 20\" limited edition prints, send your letter of inquiry to: Public Relations\nDepartment - Pan American World Airways, Inc., Pan Am Building, New York, New\nYork 10166.
