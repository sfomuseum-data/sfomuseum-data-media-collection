      "Nistoric First Flighis of Pan American Elipers\nPan American inaugurates commercial lanaplane service into\nPelgian Congo,\nFanuary 19, 1946\nThe arrival of Pan Am's Douglas DC-4 (NC88884) in Leopoldville marks the first scheduled United States-\nflag transatlantic passenger flight into the Belgian Congo with landplanes. Commanded by Captain Audrey Durst,\nthe flight inaugurated bi-monthly service between New York and Leopoldville via Newfoundland, Lisbon, and\nDakar.\nThe DC-4, which first saw service during World War Il as a military transport, marked the transition to\nlandplanes by airlines flying overseas. The introduction of the commercial DC-4 was the beginning of the end for\nPan American's world-famous flying boats.\nAbout the Artist\nIn 1926, John T. McCoy became a working student for the Curtiss Flying Ser-\nvice, Curtiss Field, Long Island, New York.\nWhen Charles A. Lindbergh arrived at Curtiss Field, his SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS\nwas housed in one of the Curtiss hangars. It was at this time that McCoy met\nLindbergh, who was most cordial and friendly to those who worked on the flight\nline. In those days muscle power was the method used for starting engines, ac-\ncomplished by swinging the propeller by hand. McCoy often pulled a prop through\nfor Lindbergh.\nYears later, when McCoy was commissioned to do paintings depicting the\nhistory of Pan American World Airways, Inc. - entitled HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHTS\nOF PAN AMERICAN CLIPPERS - he consulted with Lindbergh on the selection of\naircraft and locations for the series.\nThis is one picture in a series of thirteen.
