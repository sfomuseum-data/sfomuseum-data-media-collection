The composition is 50 stamps in a\nsheet and printed in four colors by Litho-Offset process.\nAntonio\nChuidian, Chief\nPhilatelic\nDesigner, and\nAlfonso Divina designed the stamps.\nJust 50 years ago - on November 22, 1935, one of\nthose pioneering events took place which serves as\na mile-stone in man's history-the first commercial flight\nacross the Pacific Ocean.\nThe flight of the Pan American Airways China Clip-\nper stirred the public's imagination in 1935 as do the ex-\nploits of the astronauts in 1965. The old flying boat\nmade the trail-blazing flight in island-hopping stages at\nthe then-astounding speed of 130 miles per hour in con-\ntrast to the 575 miles per hour of today's jets.\nSome 25,000 people watched the Clipper rise from\nSan Francisco Bay, head westward and fade into the\ndistance en route to Manila and the first crossing by a\ncommercial airliner of a major ocean. The New York\nTimes captioned its picture of the takeoff, \"The Lind-\nbergh dream ... comes true\".\nAt the departure ceremony, James A.
