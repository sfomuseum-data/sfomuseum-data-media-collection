The\nclimate is right. Beaches are empty. Waiting lines at golf courses and tennis\ncourts have ended with Labor Day. Rooms and airplane seats are readily\navailable.\nWe at Eastern don't want a few dollars to stand between you and your\nenjoyment of all this. So we're drastically reducing the cost of living as if\nmoney were no object.\n70 new standards of living that won't endanger your present one.\nWe've put together some 70 Eastern Autumn Weekenders - three- and\nfour-day combinations of bargain air fares, bargain hotel rates, and bargain\neverything else. As a result, a Weekender in any of dozens of places from\nMontreal to the Bahamas should cost you surprisingly little more than a\nweekend out on Scarsdale, N.Y.; Media, Pa.; Wheaton, Md.; or the town you\nlive in.\nCruise the Bahamas. $29.95* plus air fare.\nYou fly to Miami; cruise down to the Bahamas on the M/V Freeport; spend\ntwo nights at the Freeport Inn; enjoy cocktails, the floor show, and gambling in\nthe casino; sail back to Miami; and fly home. The price covers everything,\nexcept the gambling.\nRelax with the rich. $31.00* plus air fare.\nKey Biscayne, Fla., is the part-time home of too many millionaires to\nmention. At the Sonesta Beach Hotel there, you can relax not only with the\nidle rich, but like them. Leisurely continental breakfasts are served every day\non your private terrace. Your own chaise lounge awaits you by the pool, if you\nfeel up to walking over to it. Finally, there are bicycles and tennis courts, to let\nyou work off any guilt that arises from your 4 days/3 nights of idleness.\nPamper your body. $75.00* plus air fare.\nWhat Summer hasn't done to get you in shape, this Autumn Weekender will.\nIt gives you the physical benefits of Swedish massage, steam rooms, saunas,\nwhirlpool baths, yoga, and three diet-controlled meals daily. It also gives you\nthe emotional benefit of getting the physical benefits at the Fontainebleau in\nMiami Beach.\nCharter a deep-sea fishing boat. From $37.50* plus air fare.\nWe have deep-sea fishing boats sailing out of six different harbors. Which one\nod alone Miami Buch. to die go and ho much shit days like\nocean reef fishing aboard the Mucho-K for $37.50, which also covers bait,\ntackle, hotel rooms and round-trip transportation between airport, hotel, and\ndock.\nAt the other end of the scale is a $114.00. Weekender in Nassau featuring 4\ndays/3 nights at the Pilot House and two half days of deep-sea fishing on a boat\nthat fishes four but goes out even if you're the only passenger.\nYour own apartment, your own balcony, your own maid.\nFrom $30.00* plus air fare.\nFor this low price, your Autumn Weekender takes place in San Juan and\nalso includes round-trip transportation from the airport, plus a private\nswimming pool at a condominium apartment for 4 days/3 nights. If you're too\nenergetic to spend that time lolling around the pool, you can go night-clubbing,\ngambling, or exploring the closest thing to a foreign country you can visit\nwithout leaving the United States.\nYour own rock festival. $23.00* plus air fare.\nThe Castaways at Miami Beach is for people who like rock enough to spend\nfour days and three nights with it. There's rock from three live bands in the\nWreck Bar, more rock at the Inner Circle Discotheque, and still more at\npoolside during daytime. Since man cannot live by rock alone, there's also free\nfruit and a free split of cold duck in your room on arrival and two free cocktails\nthereafter.\nSave on hotel rooms, splurge on everything else.\nFrom $25.00* plus air fare.\nRooms in any of the 19 hotels in Ft. Lauderdale or Miami start at $26 for\n4 days/3 nights (San Juan $25). Which should leave you enough cash for\nfeasting at the more opulent hotels and restaurants. Or night-clubbing. Or\ngolfing. Or sightseeing. Or even gambling.\nOther Autumn Weekenders that are well within your means.\nFor details of the Autumn Weekenders you've just read about, or many\nothers, call your travel agent or Eastern. And should your current bank\nbalance prove too low for even our low prices, you can use American Express,\nBankAmericard, Master Charge,® or any other leading credit card.\nSo why stay home when you just became the kind of person that can afford\nto fly off to someplace exotic for the weekend?\nEASTERN The Wings of Man\n* Prices are seasonal; check Eastern for effective dates.
