      "definitive contract\nfor the pur-\nchase of five\nL-1011 TriStar\njetliners valued at approx-\nimately $100 million was\nexecuted in 1972 by PSA\nand Lockheed Aircraft Cor-\nporation.\nThe new contract follows\nthree years of investigation\nand evaluation by PSA to\nfind the best wide-bodied\naircraft for its quick turn-\naround, personalized, com-\nmuter service and culmi-\nnates a long study of PSA's\nwide-bodied aircraft needs.\nDuring the long eval-\nuation of the TriStar. Lock-\nheed and PSA teamed up\nto develop many features\nwhich will allow the airline\nto\n\"turn the aircraft\naround just as fast as the\nequipment presently in use\nand to give the passengers\nthe little \"extras\" they have\ncome to expect from PSA.\nAmong the new features\nis the capability of loading\nand off-loading a maximum\nnumber of passengers\nthrough four wide cabin\ndoors plus the unique abil-\nity to board over 100 pas-\nsengers with carry-on lug-\ngage through an auxiliary\nentrance.\nThe new entrance is lo-\ncated below the cabin level\nand to the rear of the be-\nlow-cabin cocktail lounge.\nPassengers with carry-on\nluggage can enter through\nthe auxiliary door, deposit\ntheir luggage in special\nracks and proceed to either\nthe cocktail lounge or the\nregular cabin. Upon arrival\nat their destination, they\ncan deplane through the\nsame entrance after retriev-\ning their luggage from the\nspecial compartment.\nPSA will be the first air-\nline to feature a below-\ncabin cocktail lounge.\nComplete with 16 saleable\nseats, all designed for the\npER\npEA",

      "acific Southwest\nAirlines is tak-\ning on a new\nlook both on\nthe ground and in the air.\nThe familiar red and white\nairplanes with the big smile\nunder the nose are being\nrepainted into a \"'new\nlook\"\nDesigned to compliment\nthe airline's changing color\nscheme, fushia, orange,\nred and whie sriDes ex-\ntend the length of the fuse-\nlace and flare up on the\nvertical stabilizer like a\nrooster tail.\nThe \"new look\" also in-\ncludes new uniforms for pi-\nlots, reservations agents,\ncounter agents, lobby\nagents and stewardesses.\nAll PSA aircraft will be re-\npainted throughout 1973\non a regular schedule that\nwill not interfere with full\nutilization of the aircraft.\nncreasecoassen-\nger traffic prompt-\ned the start of an\nexpansion program\nfor the Reservations Depart-\nment in late 1972. Walls\ntumbled down and a former\nstoreroom became part of\nthe department to make\nroom to expand the present\n84 working positions to 140\npositions. New telephone\nequipment is being in-\nstalled to handle the thou-\nsands of daily calls and\nwaiting time is being cut so\nas not to exceed eight sec-\nonds.\nA new computer will re-\nplace the former method of\nproviding flight information\nto the reservationist. At the\ntouch of a button, a small\nscreen at the reservation-\nist's desk will indicate the\nnumber of seats available\non a particular flight or, if\nthat flight is full, alternate\nflights and their space\navailability.\nThe new reservations\nsystem is expected to be\nfully operational during the\nSpring of 1973.\nThis expanded system\nwill enable a caller to book\nPSA Hotels and other hotel\nreservations and rent-a-\ncars in addition to flight\nreservations.\nG\nn an ever-increas-\ning attempt to pro-\nvide the best pos-\nsible service and\nconvenience to the Califor-\nnia air traveler, PSA ex-\npanded its route system in\n1972 to include Stockton\nand Fresno.\nAddition of these cities\ncame as a result of\nrequests from many resi-\ndents of those areas who\napproached PSA with a de-\nsire for service.\nSatellite airport service\nwas broadened in early\n1972 by providing addi-\ntional flights and new serv-\nice connecting Sacramen-\nto, Hollywood/Burbank,\nOakland and San Diego.\nThe new service was\nhighlighted by first-time,\nnon-stop flights between\nSacramento and Holly-\nwood/Burbank and be-\ntween Sacramento and San\nDiego. In addition, new\nservice was inaugurated\nbetween Oakland and Sac-\nramento providing another\nlink between the Bay Area\nand Northern California's\nCentral Valley.\nThe new service and ad-\nditional flights were de-\nsigned to alleviate traffic\ncongestion at busy Los An-\ngeles International Airport\nand San Francisco Inter-\nnational Airport by offering\nconvenient flights at less\ncongested satellite airports."
