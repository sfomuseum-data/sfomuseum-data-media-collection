Walls\ntumbled down and a former\nstoreroom became part of\nthe department to make\nroom to expand the present\n84 working positions to 140\npositions. New telephone\nequipment is being in-\nstalled to handle the thou-\nsands of daily calls and\nwaiting time is being cut so\nas not to exceed eight sec-\nonds.\nA new computer will re-\nplace the former method of\nproviding flight information\nto the reservationist. At the\ntouch of a button, a small\nscreen at the reservation-\nist's desk will indicate the\nnumber of seats available\non a particular flight or, if\nthat flight is full, alternate\nflights and their space\navailability.\nThe new reservations\nsystem is expected to be\nfully operational during the\nSpring of 1973.\nThis expanded system\nwill enable a caller to book\nPSA Hotels and other hotel\nreservations and rent-a-\ncars in addition to flight\nreservations.\nG\nn an ever-increas-\ning attempt to pro-\nvide the best pos-\nsible service and\nconvenience to the Califor-\nnia air traveler, PSA ex-\npanded its route system in\n1972 to include Stockton\nand Fresno.\nAddition of these cities\ncame as a result of\nrequests from many resi-\ndents of those areas who\napproached PSA with a de-\nsire for service.\nSatellite airport service\nwas broadened in early\n1972 by providing addi-\ntional flights and new serv-\nice connecting Sacramen-\nto, Hollywood/Burbank,\nOakland and San Diego.\nThe new service was\nhighlighted by first-time,\nnon-stop flights between\nSacramento and Holly-\nwood/Burbank and be-\ntween Sacramento and San\nDiego. In addition, new\nservice was inaugurated\nbetween Oakland and Sac-\nramento providing another\nlink between the Bay Area\nand Northern California's\nCentral Valley.\nThe new service and ad-\nditional flights were de-\nsigned to alleviate traffic\ncongestion at busy Los An-\ngeles International Airport\nand San Francisco Inter-\nnational Airport by offering\nconvenient flights at less\ncongested satellite airports.",
