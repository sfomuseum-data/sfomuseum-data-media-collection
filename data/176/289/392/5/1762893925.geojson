It is the nearest site to San Francisco located within the\narea selected by the Aerial Affairs Committee of the San\nFrancisco Chamber of Commerce, being 7½ miles in an\nair line from the San Francisco Post Office.\n2. It is within the SAN FRANCISCO SWITCHING LIMITS, thus\naffording aeroplane factories the same economic advan-\ntages as if located within San Francisco.\n3. It is valuable water front property, being located on the\nSAN\nBRUNO CANAL-\n-a Federal\nGovernment\ndefined\ncanal—which will ACCOMODATE HYDROPLANES, and at the\nsame time obtain for San Francisco water front property\nwhich will enhance in value much more rapidly because\nit is located on a defined government canal and because\nit is also within the San Francisco switching limits.\n4. It is served by Southern\nPacific, Belt Line Railroad and\nMarket Street Railroad.\n5. It is served by the new Bay Shore Highway and the Hill-\nside Boulevard and is indirectly served by the Penin-\nsula Highway and the Skyline Boulevard.\n6. It is located 1800 ft. from the Southern Pacific depot in\nSouth San Francisco.\n7. It is located on the new Bay Shore Highway 1500 ft. be-\nyond the underpass at South San Francisco.\n8. It would draw traffic from the 30 large factories located\nhere, because South san Francisco 1s within the san\nFrancisco switching limits.\nCONCLUSION\nIt meets the requirements of a MUNICIPAL AIRPORT as set\nforth to the Board of Superivsors by the various aviators and.\nexperts.\nOne of the primary policies necessary to serve, encourage\nand develop aviation is to establish numerous airports that as\nmany cities as possible should establish a municipal airport.\nCarrying out this policy the Bay cities, such as Oakland,\nAlameda and Richmond, should each have an airport and the\nSan Francisco peninsula should have several properly located,\nso that an aviator whose destination is the bay district can at\nall times depend upon finding accomodations or suitable con-\nditions at some of these airports, and be in a position to select\nthe most favorable at which to land, with respect to the ulti-\nmate destination of his passengers or cargo.\nIt meets the requirement as the practical location for San\nFrancisco's municipal airport as defined by the Department of\nCommerce wherein it states that \"when there is an option\nbetween two or more, the distance from business district and\naccessibility should be given first weight.\"",
