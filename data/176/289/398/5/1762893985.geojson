Each piece should be no larger than\n158cm (height + width + depth).\nKeep cabin baggage under 7kg.\nFor safety reasons, and for the comfort of all passengers on\nboard, you may take on board only one piece of cabin baggage\nweighing no more than 7kg. It should be able to fit in either the\noverhead locker or under the seat in front.\nIf you exceed this limit you may be asked to check in the extra.\nIf the additional weight takes you over your checked baggage\nlimit, there will be a charge.\nWe're getting the builders in.\nCHECK IN EARLY TO AVOID DELAYS.\nAuckland and Christchurch airports are busier than they've\never been.
