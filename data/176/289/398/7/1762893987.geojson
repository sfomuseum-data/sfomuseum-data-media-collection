To achieve\nthis, we need the co-operation of all travellers to adhere to\nour boarding policies:\nDOMESTIC FLIGHTS.\nAs part of our commitment to getting our flights away on\ntime, all travellers must complete check-in procedures a\nminimum of 30 minutes prior to departure. This will allow\nyou plenty of time for queuing, security screening and making\nyour way to the gate.\nTo avoid waiting in queues, don't forget to use the\nExpressCheckâ„¢ self-service kiosks in Auckland, Wellington,\nChristchurch, Nelson and Dunedin.\nINTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS.\nWe would like to remind all travellers that they should be at the\nairport 2 1 hours before an international flight to ensure that\nall check-in and passport control formalities are completed in\ntime to allow an on-time departure.\nDOMESTIC FLIGHTS CONNECTING TO AN\nINTERNATIONAL FLIGHT:\nIn order to ensure that we are able to provide you with a\nboarding pass for your onward international flight and to allow\nyour baggage to be checked through to your final destination,\nyou are required to be at the domestic airport one hour prior\nto the departure of your flight.",
