      "MONEY TALKS!\nWhen you give a tip to someone who has per-\nformed a service for you, what you are saying is\n\"thank you.\" Tipping is a language understood all\nover the world, although the rules about whom to\ntip and how much vary from country to country.\nOUR TIPPING TABLE\nThis easy-to-use table will give you an idea of the\namounts usually tipped in the major countries of\nEurope and the Middle East. If the sums shown\nseem a bit small, you may wish to give more in\nappreciation of especially fine service. Americans\nabroad are often apt to overtip.\nAs you will see in the table, hotels and restau-\nrants in many countries add a service charge to\ntheir bills. This generally amounts to 10% or 15%\nof the bill. When this is done, you need only leave\nsome small change for an employee who per-\nforms a service for you.\nSome countries add a tax to the hotel bill,\nsuch as the V.A.T. in the U.K. This should not be\nconfused with a service charge which may or may\nnot be added to the bill in addition to the tax.\nEXTRA TIPS\nIn addition to the categories listed here, you may\nalso be expected to give a number of other tips.\nWine stewards in restaurants, for example, usually\nreceive a tip equal to 10% of the cost of the wine\nyou order.\nSightseeing guides are sometimes tipped in\nEurope. When there is no fixed fee, tip the local\nequivalent of 50¢ or more, depending upon the\nTWA\nlength of the tour. If there is a fixed fee for the\nsightseeing tour, 15% of it is the right tip for the\nguide.\nIf you leave shoes to be shined outside the\ndoor of your hotel room (it's the custom in\nEngland and in many places on the Continent), be\nsure to leave a tip equal to about 35¢ a night for\nthe porter who shines them.\nOne thing more: a smile accompanying your\ntip is one of the very best ways to show that you\nreally mean to say \"thank you!\" It's sure to be\nunderstood and appreciated everywhere you go.\nNO TIPPING ON TWA!\nI've left one category out of this list of people to be\ntipped-and I'm very glad to be able to do so. You\nnever tip when you travel via TWA. Neither your\nattentive Flight Attendant nor any of the TWA\nground personnel expects a tip or is permitted to\nreceive one. However, the airport porter who\ncarries your bag through the terminal will expect\na tip.\nCONSULT THE EXPERTS\nWHEN MAKING\nYOUR PLANS\nFor help in planning a trip, selecting a tour, making\nflight and hotel reservations, visit your TWA travel\nagent and ask his or her advice. Or, call the TWA\nReservations number listed in your telephone\ndirectory to consult with our experts. TWA serves\nmajor cities across the United States and destina-\ntions throughout Europe and the Middle East.\nWe look forward to welcoming you aboard TWA."
