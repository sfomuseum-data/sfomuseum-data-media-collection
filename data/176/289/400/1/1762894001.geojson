If there is a fixed fee for the\nsightseeing tour, 15% of it is the right tip for the\nguide.\nIf you leave shoes to be shined outside the\ndoor of your hotel room (it's the custom in\nEngland and in many places on the Continent), be\nsure to leave a tip equal to about 35¢ a night for\nthe porter who shines them.\nOne thing more: a smile accompanying your\ntip is one of the very best ways to show that you\nreally mean to say \"thank you!\" It's sure to be\nunderstood and appreciated everywhere you go.\nNO TIPPING ON TWA!\nI've left one category out of this list of people to be\ntipped-and I'm very glad to be able to do so.
