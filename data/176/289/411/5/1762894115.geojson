First look outside. If fire, smoke, or water could come into the cabin through the exit, do not\nopen it. Choose another exit.\n4) If it is safe to open the exit, do so as quickly as possible. Keep the pathway to the exit clear. If the exit cannot\nbe opened, go to another exit.\n5) When the exit is open, shout \"Open seatbelts! Come this way!\" then go out the exit as quickly as possible.\n6) Do not take any carry-on baggage with you. It only gets in the way and impedes the evacuation.\n7) If there is not immediate danger, help the people behind you.
