      "BE PREPARED\nPassengers should follow all commands and signals given by crew members. Be ready to assist crewmembers in\nan emergency and to follow the guidelines below.\n1) Know where all the exits are on this aircraft. Study the briefing card and know how to open the exit closest to\nyou. Ask a crewmember if you have any questions about this.\n2) Remember, keep your head down until the aircraft has come to a complete stop. Do not look up and around\nuntil you are certain the aircraft is no longer moving.\n3) If an emergency evacuation is necessary, and if a crewmember cannot get to the exit in your row, you may\nhave to open it. First look outside. If fire, smoke, or water could come into the cabin through the exit, do not\nopen it. Choose another exit.\n4) If it is safe to open the exit, do so as quickly as possible. Keep the pathway to the exit clear. If the exit cannot\nbe opened, go to another exit.\n5) When the exit is open, shout \"Open seatbelts! Come this way!\" then go out the exit as quickly as possible.\n6) Do not take any carry-on baggage with you. It only gets in the way and impedes the evacuation.\n7) If there is not immediate danger, help the people behind you. Direct passengers away from any dangers, such\nas fire, smoke, water, or moving propellers.\n8) Move away from the aircraft as soon and as quickly as you can.\nTO SIT IN AN EXIT ROW\nIn order to ensure the fastest possible emergency evacuation, the Federal Aviation Administration has set\nstandards for people who sit in rows next to exits. In the event of an emergency, these passengers may be called\nupon to assist crewmembers in the evacuation.\nPassengers sitting in exit row seats must be willing and able to do the following:\n1. Locate the emergency exit and move to it quickly;\n2. Recognize the opening mechanism, comprehend the instructions, then open the exit at the proper time;\n3. Decide if opening the exit will increase hazards to passengers;\n4. Follow instructions given by crewmembers;\n5. Stow the exit doors or windows;\n6. Pass quickly through the door and then assess, select, and follow a safe path away from the aircraft.\nIn order to perform these functions, passengers sitting in emergency exit rows must:\nA. Read English well enough to understand the instructions for opening exits and for other emergency\nB. See well enough to read instructions, to see signals given by crewmembers and to look outside for dangers\nsuch as smoke, fire or water which would make the exit unusable. You can wear glasses or contact lenses.\nC. Hear well enough to understand English commands. You can use a hearing aid.\nD. Speak well enough to give information in English to crewmembers or other passengers during an emergency.\nE. Be able to use both hands, both arms and both legs, as well as be strong and flexible enough to do the\nfollowing:\n1. Be able to quickly open the exit. This will require that you be able to reach up, sideways and down and\nbe able to grasp the door mechanism.\n2. Be able to lift the exit window out of the exit; some window hatches that must be lifted can weigh as\nmuch as 65 pounds (30 Kgs.), the average weight of a 7-year-old child.\n3. Be able to clear from the exit any obstructions weighing up to 65 pounds and maintain balance while\ndoing so.\n4. Be able to quickly move to and through the exit.\n5. Be able to help other passengers away from the plane.\nF. Be at least 15 years of age.\nG. Have the capacity to perform these functions without a companion or adult.\nH. Be with no one that requires your care, such as a small child, or someone physically or mentally unable to\ncare for themselves.\nI. You must be willing and able to do all of these things by yourself and without harming yourself.\nIf you cannot or do not wish to perform these tasks, you cannot sit in an emergency exit row seat. If you are\nalready seated there, ask a crewmember to move you to another seat. You do not have to explain why. You need\nsay only \"I do not want to sit in an exit row.\"\nDO NOT REMOVE THIS CARD FROM AIRCRAFT\n1F017 12/00\nA Delta Connection®\n454"
