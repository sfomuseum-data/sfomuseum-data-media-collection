      "CONVAIR 580\nBRACE POSITION\nWhen so directed, assume this position before and\nduring landing. With seat belt fastened, place both\nfeet together on the floor in front of you, lean\nforward and down as far as possible and clasp hands\nfirmly under legs.\nWhere time permits, flight attendant will pass out blankets and pillows for padding.\nA word about Seats and Seat Belts\nThe \"Fasten Seat Belt\" sign is located directly above the cabin entrance at the forward end of the cabin. Rough air\n(turbulence) at high altitudes, although infrequent, can be severe. When the seat belt sign is illuminated in-flight,\nplease comply with the sign to prevent possible injury. Seasoned air travelers usually leave their seat belts fastened\nall the time and pull them snug whenever the seat belt sign is lighted.\nFLOTATION CUSHION\nFlotation Seat Cushions\nYour seat cushion is a life preserver. In event of emergency ditching on\nwater, grasp the back of the cushion and pull upward to remove. Take it\nwith you and use straps as shown.\nSmoking\nThe \"No Smoking\"' sign is located directly above the cabin entrance at the forward end of the Cabin. When the sign\nis off, you may smoke while seated in a smoking area of the Cabin. When the sign is illuminated, however, smoking\nwill not be permitted.\nPets In The Cabin\nA pet being transported in the cabin must remain in its kennel and the kennel must remain under the seat at\nall times.\nFEDERAL REGULATIONS\nSeat Backs and Seat Trays\nEach passenger seat back and seat tray must be in an upright position prior to taxiing, take-off or landing.\nEach passenger must comply with instructions given by crew members in compliance with this regulation.\nAlcoholic Beverages\nNo person shall drink any alcoholic beverage aboard an air carrier unless such beverage has been served to\nhim/her by the air carrier operating the aircraft.\nNo air carrier shall serve any alcoholic beverage to any person aboard an air carrier aircraft if such person\nappears to be intoxicated.\nNo air carrier shall permit any person to board an air carrier aircraft if such person appears to be intoxicated.\nAlcoholic beverages cannot be served to minors.\nPortable Electronic Devices\nONLY PORTABLE VOICE RECORDERS, HEARING AIDS, HEART PACEMAKERS, AND ELECTRIC\nSHAVERS MAY BE USED WHILE AIRCRAFT IS IN FLIGHT. Portable radios (AM or FM), TV receivers\nand other electronic devices may have circuits which radiate signals. These circuits act like miniature\nbroadcasting stations and, in some cases, these signals are strong enough to interfere with the aircraft's radio\nnaviation systems.\nIn recognition of this and to insure your safety, all airlines found it necessary to prohibit the use of these\nitems in trignt.\nCarry-on Baggage\nCarry-on baggage is limited to an amount that can be placed beneath the seat, with the exception of hang-up\nbags which may be hung in the closet, and coats and hats which may be placed in the overhead rack. ALL\nCARRY-ON RETAINED BY THE PASSENGER MUST BE PLACED BENEATH THE SEAT DURING\nTAKE-OFF AND LANDING.\nNo-Smoking Section\nA seat must be provided for each person desiring a seat in the No-Smoking Section. It is frequently necessary\nto expand the No-Smoking Section to accommodate everyone. In the event of a full flight it is, sometimes,\nnecessary to seat smokers in the remaining seats of the last No-Smoking row. Smoking is prohibited in all\nrows permanently or temporarily designated \"No-Smoking\".\nDO NOT TAKE THIS CARD FROM THE AIRCRAFT\n9-76"
