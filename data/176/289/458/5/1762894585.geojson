Rough air\n(turbulence) at high altitudes, although infrequent, can be severe. When the seat belt sign is illuminated in-flight,\nplease comply with the sign to prevent possible injury. Seasoned air travelers usually leave their seat belts fastened\nall the time and pull them snug whenever the seat belt sign is lighted.\nFLOTATION CUSHION\nFlotation Seat Cushions\nYour seat cushion is a life preserver. In event of emergency ditching on\nwater, grasp the back of the cushion and pull upward to remove. Take it\nwith you and use straps as shown.\nSmoking\nThe \"No Smoking\"' sign is located directly above the cabin entrance at the forward end of the Cabin.
