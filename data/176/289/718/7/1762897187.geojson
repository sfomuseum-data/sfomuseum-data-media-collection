Brant, Commander of Crissy\nField, and B. E. Mouton,\nAeronautical Inspector for\nthe Department of Commerca, are the other members of\nmy Committee.\nWe have held several meetings and it is the\nconsensus of opinion of our Advisory Committee that\nthe City of San francisco needs a really good municipal\nairport.\nIn spite of adverse criticisms of Mills\n4 airport, if sufficient money is spent upon it by the\nHomever, we naturally feel that\nCity cannot spend a great sum of money on this\nfield until title is vested in the City of San Francisco.\nAlready, certain of the Supervisors are trying to make\na political football out of this issue and the only\nresult will be to retard\nthe development of a first-\nclass airport for our City.\nI am writing to you because I feel that the\nperpetuation\nof the memory\nyour father in the name\n\"wils Field\",\nand the\nwelfare of the\nCity of San Iran-\ncisco, are both matters of great interest and concern\nto you.\nI feel that it would be much better to purchase the\nproperty from you directly, than to attempt to\ncondemn it for City purposes,\nas was recently\nsuggested\nof the Supervisors.\nI feel that you have a\nsplendid opportunity to gain the affection and good will\nof the citizens of San Francisco by making us a liberal\noffer for the purchase of\nproperty,\nand I feel\nthat if such an offer is made by you that the transaction\ncan be quickly consurmated.\nI am writing this frankly to you because I\nfeel the situation should not be allowed to drag on, but",
