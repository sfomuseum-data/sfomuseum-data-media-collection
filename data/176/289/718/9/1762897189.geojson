Kouton, had flow\nmany occasions and were of the belief that many of the arguments\nadvanced by opponents of the field had their origin in the fact that\nthe flold was only partially developed and was not due to any in-\nherent fauits in the fleld itself.\nTe all\nwas\n, felt that the location\nsatisfactory as an airport base, and that, with the addition\nof more land; the additional drainage of a large portion of the\nproposed augmented field; the construction of proper runways and\nsatisfactory hangar space; satisfactory flood lighting for night\nlandings, and other improvements, the field would be a first-olass\nairport.\nAt this first meeting, however, Ir.Mouton earnestly\nsuggested that immediate steps be taken to secure definite knowledge\nas co\nthe possibilities of immediate vesting of title in the City\nfor the lend occupied by lills Meld.\nBoth Colonel Brant and my-\nself vigorously supported Ir. Mouton and stated that we could not\nas a o1tizens Advisory Committee, recommend that money be expended\nfor permanent improvements until we were certain that the field\ncould, either by purohase or by proper and legal condemnation, be\nseoured for the City within the very imediate future.\nYou there-\nupon assured us that a gentleman's agreement had been entered into\nwith Me. Mills wheredy it was asswed that purchase of the field\nwould be possible as soon as the City of sen Francisco secured the\nnecessary money.\nThe study, subsequent action and recommendations\nof this Comittee, have been based upon this understanding that the\nfold could be purchased by the City and that any expenditures\nwould not be wasted on property to which the City of San Francisco\ncould never have title.\nSubsequent to the meeting of Mey 3rd, our Comittee en-\ngaged in correspondence and consultation with various experts re-\ngarding the situation at Ills Pleld, but held no further meetings\nwith your Airport Committee of the Board of Supervisors, until\nyour call for a second meeting.\nThis meeting was held on\nJuly 10th\nat the Palace Hotel.\nthe\nAt this meeting the question of purchasing\nairport, or condemning it, was again the principal question\nfor discussion,\nColonel' Brant surrested his willingness to get in\ntouch with Mr. Ills, through I. Trubee Davidson, Assistant Seore-\ntary of War; and I suggested ay willingness to get in touch with\nhim, and you gave us assurance that the matter was being negotiated.\nYou then presented for the consideration of the Advisory\nCommittee a fIle, No. 531.14, called\n\"Budget Items - 1929-1930m\nin which the budget\nare set forth.\nrequirements of M111s Fleld for the current year\nThese budget items were set forth under three sate-\ngories:",
