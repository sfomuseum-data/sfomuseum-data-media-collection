Brant, Commander of Crissy\nField, and B. E. Mouton,\nAeronautical Inspector for\nthe Department of Commerca, are the other members of\nmy Committee.\nWe have held several meetings and it is the\nconsensus of opinion of our Advisory Committee that\nthe City of San francisco needs a really good municipal\nairport.\nIn spite of adverse criticisms of Mills\n4 airport, if sufficient money is spent upon it by the\nHomever, we naturally feel that\nCity cannot spend a great sum of money on this\nfield until title is vested in the City of San Francisco.\nAlready, certain of the Supervisors are trying to make\na political football out of this issue and the only\nresult will be to retard\nthe development of a first-\nclass airport for our City.\nI am writing to you because I feel that the\nperpetuation\nof the memory\nyour father in the name\n\"wils Field\",\nand the\nwelfare of the\nCity of San Iran-\ncisco, are both matters of great interest and concern\nto you.\nI feel that it would be much better to purchase the\nproperty from you directly, than to attempt to\ncondemn it for City purposes,\nas was recently\nsuggested\nof the Supervisors.\nI feel that you have a\nsplendid opportunity to gain the affection and good will\nof the citizens of San Francisco by making us a liberal\noffer for the purchase of\nproperty,\nand I feel\nthat if such an offer is made by you that the transaction\ncan be quickly consurmated.\nI am writing this frankly to you because I\nfeel the situation should not be allowed to drag on, but",

      "- 2 -\nsuggested as municipal airports.\nAll of the members of our Advisory\ncommittee had previously visited and inspected Mills Field, and two\nof the members, Colonel Brant and E.\nE. Mouton, had flow there on\nmany occasions and were of the belief that many of the arguments\nadvanced by opponents of the field had their origin in the fact that\nthe field was only partially developed and was not due to any in-\nherent faults in the field itself.\nWe all felt that the location\nwas satisfactory as an airport base, and that, with the addition\nof more lana;\nthe additional drainage of a large portion of the\nproposed augmented field; the construction of proper runways\nsatisfactory hangar space; satisfactory flood lighting for night\nlandings, and\nother improvements, the field would be a first-class\nAt this first meeting, however, Ir.Mouton earnestly\nsuggested that immediate steps be taken to\nsecure definite knowledge\nas to the possibilities of immediate\nvesting of title in the City\nfor the land occupied by Mills Field.\nBoth Colonel Brant and my-\nself vigorously supported Mr. Mouton and stated that we could not\n202 permanent aprones ittle were ce that that he espended\ncould, either by purchase or by proper and legal condemnation, be\nsecured for the\nCity within the\nvery immediate\nYou there-\nupon assured us that a gentleman's agreement had been entered into\nwith Mr. Mills whereby it was\nassured that purchase of the field\nwould be possible as soon as the City of Sen\nFrancisco secured the\nnecessary money.\nThe study, subsequent action and recommendations\nof this Committee, have been\nbased upon this understanding that the\nfield could be purchased by the City\nand that any expenditures\nwould not be wasted on property to which the City of San Francisco\ncould never have title.\ngaged in correspondence\ngarding the\nsituation at lills Field, but held no further meetings\nwith your Airport Committee of the Board of Supervisors, until\nyour call for\na second neeting.\nat the Palace Hotel.\nThis meeting was held on July 10th\nAt this meeting the question of purchasing\nche airport,\nfor disaster colonel\nColonel Brant sagested his Minanga s 00 807 1n\ntouch with Mr. Mills, through I.

M1l1s, under date of August 21st, as follows:\nHon. Ogden Mills\nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury\nWashington, D.

Brant, Commander of Crissy\nField, and B. E. Mouton,\nAeronautical Inspector for\nthe Department of Commerca, are the other members of\nmy Committee.\nWe have held several meetings and it is the\nconsensus of opinion of our Advisory Committee that\nthe City of San francisco needs a really good municipal\nairport.\nIn spite of adverse criticisms of Mills\n4 airport, if sufficient money is spent upon it by the\nHomever, we naturally feel that\nCity cannot spend a great sum of money on this\nfield until title is vested in the City of San Francisco.\nAlready, certain of the Supervisors are trying to make\na political football out of this issue and the only\nresult will be to retard\nthe development of a first-\nclass airport for our City.\nI am writing to you because I feel that the\nperpetuation\nof the memory\nyour father in the name\n\"wils Field\",\nand the\nwelfare of the\nCity of San Iran-\ncisco, are both matters of great interest and concern\nto you.\nI feel that it would be much better to purchase the\nproperty from you directly, than to attempt to\ncondemn it for City purposes,\nas was recently\nsuggested\nof the Supervisors.\nI feel that you have a\nsplendid opportunity to gain the affection and good will\nof the citizens of San Francisco by making us a liberal\noffer for the purchase of\nproperty,\nand I feel\nthat if such an offer is made by you that the transaction\ncan be quickly consurmated.\nI am writing this frankly to you because I\nfeel the situation should not be allowed to drag on, but",
      "-5-\nthat a constructive program should be made in\nthe very near future, and,\nas Chairman of the Air-\nport Advisory\nCommittee I feel it is my duty to\nrecomnend a definite program as quickly as possible.\nTrusting I may hear fron you regarding this\nmatter at your earliest convenience, I am\nYours very sincerely,\n(Sga.) William G. Marvin\nMr. M111s then replied to my letter under date of September 3rd,\nas follows:\n16 Broad Street\nNew York\nSeptember 3rd, 1929•\nWilliam G. Marvin, Esq.,\n515 Montgomery Street,\nSan Frencisco, California.\nMy dear Mr. Marvin:\nI have your courteous letter of August\n21st and appreciate the friendly spirit in which\nyou write.\nThere seems to be some confusion as to\nthe Mills Field situation.\nMy Father leased the field to the City\nwith the understanding that the\nCity could use it\nmore\nor less on an\nexperimental basis until a perma-\nnent location could be found.\nThere was no intention\non his part to sell the field to the city as a perma-\nnent\nair port, nor do I understand\nthat\nthe City\ncontemplated such a progran at that time.\nYou suggest that this is a fine\noppor-\ntunity to gain the affection and good will of\nthe\ncitizens of San Francisco by making a liberal offer\nfor the purchase of this property.\nIn this connec-\ntion you should understand that it does not belong to\nme and that insofar as I am responsible for its manage-\nment I am acting as a Trustee, bound\nto protect\nthe\ninterests of a number of other people, some of them\nminors, as well as my\nown interests.\nUnder these cir-\ncumstances I feel that you will appreciate that I am",
      "-6-\nnot in a position to make a generous gesture, nor\nis my Aunt, Mrs. Whitlaw Reid.\nMoreover, as we vien\nsituation, the\nproperty is by no means an ideal\nsite for an air\nport while, on the\nother hand,\nit should be extreme-\nly available some day for industrial purposes.\nI\ndo not know any other property\nin the vicinity of\nSan francisco\nso well\nadapted to the industrial develop-\nment\nwhich,\nin the long run,\nwould mean a great deal\nmore\nto San Irancisco than\nthe\nlocation there\nof an\nair port for which a more\nsuitable site can, I am\ninformed, be found\nelsewhere.\nTrusting you will understand my position,\nbelieve\nme,\nSincerely yours,\n(Signed) OGDEN L. MILLS\nwhich was\nTuesday,\nSeptand 10 Wonder a a 011day. I telephoned\nto you before showing the letter to any one else.\nAs I was not\nable to get you on\nthe telephone, I held the letter in confidence\nuntil such\nwy of 20e on mednesday, september 1ith, and 1 gave you the origina\ntime as I could talk it over with\nYou then came to\nthis letter to read.\nImmediately thereafter, I communicated its contents to\nmy fellow members on the Advisory\nCommittee.\nWe were sorry to re-\nceive the lecter,\nin so far as it seemed to close the gate for\nfurther negotiations with Mr. Mills, but all of us felt that it was\nbetter\nto have the matter brought to a definite head as soon as\npossible.\nIn conclusion, I might state that our Committee feels\nthat, if proper legal\nauthority will recommend condemnation pro-\nceedings\nunder the\nState law,\nas being reasonably certain of\nsuccess,\nthe City should make every effort\nto get title to this\nproperty before making further\nexpendi tures.\nAt the same time,\nwe feel that the taz payers of San Francisco should be protected\nagainst other than absolutely necessary outlays, until the ques-\ntion of\ntitle is definitely determined.\nYours very truly,\nVin.
