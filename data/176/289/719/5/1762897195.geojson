      "COPY\nSeptember 18, 1929.\nTo the Hon. Milo H. Kent\nChairman of the Airport Comnittee,\nBoard of Supervisors,\nCity of San Francisco,\nCalifornia,\nSir:\nInasmuch as the Chairman of the advisory Committee on\nAviation to the City of San Francisco, is leaving on a trip,\nBurope, which will consure at least two months time, a meeting of\nthe Advisory Committee was held on this date, in order that this\nreport could be furnished to you of the unanimous sentiment, feel-\nings and recormendations of the Advisory Comittee.\nIn oase you, or the Board of Supervisors, find it\nnecessary to possess any further details regarding the attitude\nof this Committee, during my absence, you on cal 1 upon Lieutenant-\nColonel Gerald C.\nthe Comittee,\nBrant, or B. B. Mouton, the other members of\nfor such Information.\nThere is no divergence of\nopinion among the members of this Comittee,\nrecommendations they may make\nand any statement or\ncan be considered as having my\nheartiest endorsement and approval.\nOn larch 26th last, Ir. Marshall Fale, President of the\nDown Town Association, stated that he had recommended me, as Chair-\nman of the Aviation Committee of the Down Town Association, to be\na member of the Advisory Committee on Aviation, to be appointed by\nthe Mayor.\nOn\nApril 8th last, I read in the newspapers that such\na committee had been appointed, consisting of Lieutenant-Colonel\nGerald C. Brant and 3.\nB. Mouton and myself but that you had ex-\npressed some uncertainty as to the possibility of securing Colonel\nBrant, or Ir. Mouton, because of their federal connections.\nI\ncalled you on the telephone several times between that date and\nthe date of the first meeting of our Committee, on May 3, 1929.\nand was informed by you that the personnel of the Comittee had\nnot yet been definitely determined, because of Wer Department objet-\nions to the service of Colonel Brant on the Cormittee.\nWhen our Advisory Committee finally did meet with your\nAirport Comittee in joint conference, on May 3, 1929, at the Palace\nHotel, the entire situation was informally discussed.\nThe members\nof our Committee were in agreement with the facts presented by you\nthat Mills Fleld, 1f properly developed, would make a satisfactory\naviation base (as distinguished from aviation terminal).\nYou at\nto prove that Mills Field was the most satisfactory\nsix available sites in the environs of San Francisco which had been",
      "suggested as municipal airports.\nAll of the members of our Advisory\nof the mombers, Colonel Brant and 3. 3. Kouton, had flow\nmany occasions and were of the belief that many of the arguments\nadvanced by opponents of the field had their origin in the fact that\nthe flold was only partially developed and was not due to any in-\nherent fauits in the fleld itself.\nTe all\nwas\n, felt that the location\nsatisfactory as an airport base, and that, with the addition\nof more land; the additional drainage of a large portion of the\nproposed augmented field; the construction of proper runways and\nsatisfactory hangar space; satisfactory flood lighting for night\nlandings, and other improvements, the field would be a first-olass\nairport.\nAt this first meeting, however, Ir.Mouton earnestly\nsuggested that immediate steps be taken to secure definite knowledge\nas co\nthe possibilities of immediate vesting of title in the City\nfor the lend occupied by lills Meld.\nBoth Colonel Brant and my-\nself vigorously supported Ir. Mouton and stated that we could not\nas a o1tizens Advisory Committee, recommend that money be expended\nfor permanent improvements until we were certain that the field\ncould, either by purohase or by proper and legal condemnation, be\nseoured for the City within the very imediate future.\nYou there-\nupon assured us that a gentleman's agreement had been entered into\nwith Me. Mills wheredy it was asswed that purchase of the field\nwould be possible as soon as the City of sen Francisco secured the\nnecessary money.\nThe study, subsequent action and recommendations\nof this Comittee, have been based upon this understanding that the\nfold could be purchased by the City and that any expenditures\nwould not be wasted on property to which the City of San Francisco\ncould never have title.\nSubsequent to the meeting of Mey 3rd, our Comittee en-\ngaged in correspondence and consultation with various experts re-\ngarding the situation at Ills Pleld, but held no further meetings\nwith your Airport Committee of the Board of Supervisors, until\nyour call for a second meeting.\nThis meeting was held on\nJuly 10th\nat the Palace Hotel.\nthe\nAt this meeting the question of purchasing\nairport, or condemning it, was again the principal question\nfor discussion,\nColonel' Brant surrested his willingness to get in\ntouch with Mr. Ills, through I. Trubee Davidson, Assistant Seore-\ntary of War; and I suggested ay willingness to get in touch with\nhim, and you gave us assurance that the matter was being negotiated.\nYou then presented for the consideration of the Advisory\nCommittee a fIle, No. 531.14, called\n\"Budget Items - 1929-1930m\nin which the budget\nare set forth.\nrequirements of M111s Fleld for the current year\nThese budget items were set forth under three sate-\ngories:",
      "Items most essential\nEssential items\nDesirable items\nThe total of \"Items most essential\" was $802,280; the total\nof \"Essent lol 1tems\" was $843, 770, and the total of\n\"Desirable\nitem\" was 52,645, making a grand 1 totel of 898,675.00. In the\n\"Items most essential\" was included\n411,000\nfor the purchase of\n1595 aores of reclaimed land and tidelands, which would constitute\nthe expanded area of Mills Pleld; and other Items were inoluded of\na permanent nacure.\nIn discussing this budget program, our Committee took the\nstand that with the small appropriation available for the airport\nduring the ourrent year, and with the title still remaining in\nother parties then the\nCity it would only be advisable to spend\nsuch moneys as were necessary for keeping the field in flying\ncondition and for operating the same.\nOur Committee realized that\nthere are certain tenants at Mills Pleld who are paying rents and\nwho must be kept satisfied, and we realized that so much money had\nalready been put into the field that the investment could not be\nJeopardized by allowing it to deteriorate\nwould be made hazardous or unreliable.\nso that flying conditions\nany expenditures approved by vol laolid be I there one. radti*,\ntherefore, felt that\nnon-permanent expenditures, which were necessary for the operation\nand maintenence of the field.\nUpon your assurance that the field could be purchased, we\nalso epproved certain other minor items of a permanent nature which\nwe felt necessary if the air field was to be properly improved.\nHowever, no items in the second and third categories, 1, e.\ntial 1tems\" and \"Desirable Items\" were approved.\n\"Essen-\nBefore the meeting of July 10th adjourned, I asked you 1f.\n1t would interfere\nand\nwith your plens\n1f I got in touch with it, Mills\nfound out his attitude toward the sale of this\ned you thought this would be very helpful.\nland.\nYou stat-\nour Committee wanted a definite\nI explained to you that\nstatement of the attitude of Mr.\nmills toward the disposition of this property.\nImmediately after this meeting I left on my vacation and did\nnot return for some two or three weeks, but upon my return I wrote\nto Mr. Ogden L. Mills, under date of August 2lst, as follows:\nHon. Ogden M11s\nAssistant Seoretary of the Treasury\nWashington, D. C.\nMy dear Mr. Mills:\nPerhaps you will not recall meeting me several\nyears ago in New York.\nYou mey recall me, however,\n88\nDirector of the Hoover-Curtis Clubs In the state of Cell-",
      "fornia during the recent campaign.\nI em writing to you because I was recently\nappointed Chairmen of the\nAirport Advisory Committee to\nthe Board of Supervisors to the City of Sen Francisco.\nIleutenant-Colonel Gerald C. Brant, Commander of Crissy\nFleld, and E. E. Mouton, Aeronautioal Inspector for\nthe Department of Commerca, are the other members of\nmy Committee.\nWe have held several meetings and it is the\nconsensus of opinion of our Advisory Cormittee that\nthe City of San Francisco needs a really good municipal\nairport.\nIn spite of adverse critiolsms of M11s\nTold, wo, who aro all practioal flyers, feel that\nMills Pled en be developed eventually into a Class\nA airport, if sufficient money is spent upon it by the\ncity of Sen Francisco.\nHowever, we naturally fool that\nthe City cannot spend a great sum of money on this\nfield until title is vested in the City of Sen Francisco.\nAlready, certain of the Supervisors are trying to make\na political football out of this issue and the only\nresult will be to reterd the development of a first-\nclass airport for our city.\nI am writing to you beause I feel that the\nperpetuation of the memory of your father in the name\n, and the welfare of the City of Sen Iran-\n01sco, are both matters of great interest and concern\nto you.\nI feel that it would be much better to purchase the\nproperty from you direotly, than to attempt\ncondemn it for\nCity purposes, as was recently suggested\nby one of the Supervisors.\nsplendid opportunity to gain\nfeel that you have\nI the affection and good will\nof the citizens of Sen Francisco by malng us a liberal\noffer for the purchase of this property, and I feel\nthat 11 such an offer 1s made by you that the transaction\ncan be quickly consumated.\nI am writing this frankly to you beause I\nfeel the situation should not be allowed to drag on, but",
      "-5-\nthat a constructive progran should be made in\nthe very near future, and, as Chairman of the Air-\nport Advisory Committeo I feel it is my duty to\nrecommend a definite progren as quickly as possible.\nTrusting I may hear fron you regording this\nmatter at your earliest convenience, I\nYours very sinoerely,\n(Sga.)

      "-6.\nnot in a position to make a generous gesture, nor\n1s my Aunt, Is, whitlaw Reid.\nMoreover, as we vien the situation, the\nproperty is by no means an ideal site for an air\nport while, on the other hand, it should be extreme-\n1y available some day for industrial purposes.\ndo not know any other property in the\nÑ€Ð¸Ð¾Ð»Ð½Ð°g o?\nSan Francisco so well adapted to the industrial devolop-\nment which, in the long run, would mean a great deal\nmore to San Francisco than the location there of an\nair port for which a more suitable site can, I am\ninformed, be found elsewhere.\nTrusting you will understand my position,\nbelleve me,\nSincerely yours,\n(Signed)\nOGDEN L.
