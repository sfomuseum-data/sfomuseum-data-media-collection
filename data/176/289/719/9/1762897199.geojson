Mills whereby it was assured that purchase of the field\nwould be possible as soon as the City of Sen Francisco secured the\nnecessary money.\nThe study, subsequent action and reconnendations\nof this Comittee, have been based upon this understanding that the\nfield could be purchased by the City and that any expenditures\nwould not be wasted on property to which the City of Sen Franoisco\ncould nover have title,\nsubsequent to the neoting of lay 3rd, our Committee on-\nseged in correspondence and consultation with various experts re-\ncarding the situation at Mills Yield, but held no further meetings\nwith your Airport Committee of the\nBoard of Supervisors, until\nyour cell for a second meeting.\nThis meeting was held on July 10th\nat the Pelace Hotel.\nAt this meeting the question of purchasing\nthe airport, or condemning 1t, was again the principal question\nfor discussion,\nColonel Brant suggested his willingness to get in\ntouch with it. Atlls, through 7. Trubee Davidson, Assistant Secre-\ntary of War; and I suggested my willingness to get\nin touch with\nhim, and you gave us assurance that the matter was being negotiated.\nYou then presented for the consideration of the Advisory\nCommittee a file, lo. 831.1, called \"Budgot Itens - 1929-1930°\nin which the budget requirements of Mills Fleld for the current year\nare set forth.\nThese budget items were set forth under three cate-\ngories:",
      "(11\nItems most essential\n(3)\nEssential items\nDeafrable items\nThe total of \"Iteme most essential\" was $602,360; the total\nof \"Essent lol Items\" was $243,770, and the total\n\"Desirable\niteng\"\nmaking a grand totel of $898,675.00.\nIn the\n\"Items most essential\" was included 411,000 for the purcnase.\nof\n1595 acres of reclaimed land and tidelands, which would constitute\nthe expanded area of Mills Field; and other items were Included of\na permanent nature.\nIn d1 soussing this budget progran, our Comnittee took the\nstand that with the small appropriation available for the airport\nduring the ourrent yoar, and with the title atill remaining in\nother parties then the City, it would only be advisable to spend\nsuch moneys as were necessary for keeping the field in flying\ncondition and for operating the sene.\nOur Committee realized that\nthere are certain tenants at Mille Pleld who are paying rents and\nwho met be kept satisfied, and we realized that so much money had\nalready been put into the fleld that the investmont could not be\nJeopardized by ollowing 1t to deteriorate so that flying conditions\nwould be made hazardous or unreliable.\ntherefore, folt that\nany expenditures approved by us should to linited to Btrioti\nnon-permanent expenditures, which were nocessary for the operation\nand maintenance of the flel.de\nUpon your assurence that the field could be purchased, we\nalso approved certain other minor items of a permanent nature which\nwe felt necessary if the air field was to be properly improved.\nHowever, no items in the second and third categories, i. e.\ntial items\" and \"Desirable Items\" were approved.\n\"Essen-\nBefore the meeting of July 10th adjourned, I asked you if\nit would interfere with your plons 1f I got in touch with Ir. M1118\nand found out his attitude toward the sale or this land.\nYou etat-\ned you thought this would be very helpful.\nI explained to you that\nour Committee wanted a definite statement of the attitude of Mr.\nMills toward the disposition of this property.\nImmediately after this meeting I left on my vacation and did\nnot return for some two or three weeks, but upon my return I wrote\nto Mr. Ogden L.
