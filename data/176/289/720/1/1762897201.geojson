Mouton and myself\npressed some uncertainty as to\nBrant, or It. Mouton, because of their federal connections.\ncalled you on the telephone several times between that date and\nthe date inform a by for elan * no personnel be 420 00 5600 .2.,\nand was informed by you that\nnot yet been definitely determined, because of War Depertment objeot-\nlons to the service of Colonel Brant on the Cormittee.\nThen our Advisory Committee finally did meet with your\nAirport Comittee in Joint conference, on May 3, 192, at the Palace\nThe members\nComittee were in agreement with the facts presented by you\naviation base (as distinguished\nsatisfactory\nYou at\nsix available sites in the environs of San Irancisco thich had been",
      "suggested as minicipal airports.\nA11 of the members of our Advisory\nCommittee had previously visited and inspected 1111s\nof\nField,\nthe mombers, Colonel Brant\nand two\nand so Do Mouton, had 110m ' there on\nmany occasions and were of the belief that many of the arguments\nadvanced by opponents of the fleld had their orfein in the fact that\nthe field was only pertielly developed and was not due to any in-\nherent faults in the fleld itself.\nTe all felt that the location\nof more land;\nadditional drainare of a large portion of the\nproposed augnented field; the construction of proper runways and\nsatisfactory hangar space;\nsatiefactory flood\nlandings, and other\n11phting for nicht\nimprovemente, the field would be a first-class\nairport.\nAt this first meeting, horever, Ir.Mouton earnestly\nsuggested that immediate eteps be taken to secure definite knowledge\nas to the possibilities of limediate vesting of title in the City\nfor the land occupied by ills Meld.\nBoth Colonel Brant and my-\nself vigorously supported Ir. louton and stated that we could not\nas a c1tizens Advisory Comittee, reconnend that money be expended\nfor permanent improvements until we were certain that the fleld\ncould, either by purchase or by proper and legal condemnation, be\nsecured for the City within the very immediate future.\nYou there-\nupon assured us that a gentleman's agreement had been entered into\nwith tr. Mills whereby it was assured that purchase of the field\nwould be possible as soon as the City of Sen Francisco secured the\nnecessary money.\nThe study, subsequent action and reconnendations\nof this Comittee, have been based upon this understanding that the\nfield could be purchased by the City and that any expenditures\nwould not be wasted on property to which the City of Sen Franoisco\ncould nover have title,\nsubsequent to the neoting of lay 3rd, our Committee on-\nseged in correspondence and consultation with various experts re-\ncarding the situation at Mills Yield, but held no further meetings\nwith your Airport Committee of the\nBoard of Supervisors, until\nyour cell for a second meeting.\nThis meeting was held on July 10th\nat the Pelace Hotel.\nAt this meeting the question of purchasing\nthe airport, or condemning 1t, was again the principal question\nfor discussion,\nColonel Brant suggested his willingness to get in\ntouch with it. Atlls, through 7. Trubee Davidson, Assistant Secre-\ntary of War; and I suggested my willingness to get\nin touch with\nhim, and you gave us assurance that the matter was being negotiated.\nYou then presented for the consideration of the Advisory\nCommittee a file, lo. 831.1, called \"Budgot Itens - 1929-1930°\nin which the budget requirements of Mills Fleld for the current year\nare set forth.\nThese budget items were set forth under three cate-\ngories:",
      "(11\nItems most essential\n(3)\nEssential items\nDeafrable items\nThe total of \"Iteme most essential\" was $602,360; the total\nof \"Essent lol Items\" was $243,770, and the total\n\"Desirable\niteng\"\nmaking a grand totel of $898,675.00.\nIn the\n\"Items most essential\" was included 411,000 for the purcnase.\nof\n1595 acres of reclaimed land and tidelands, which would constitute\nthe expanded area of Mills Field; and other items were Included of\na permanent nature.\nIn d1 soussing this budget progran, our Comnittee took the\nstand that with the small appropriation available for the airport\nduring the ourrent yoar, and with the title atill remaining in\nother parties then the City, it would only be advisable to spend\nsuch moneys as were necessary for keeping the field in flying\ncondition and for operating the sene.\nOur Committee realized that\nthere are certain tenants at Mille Pleld who are paying rents and\nwho met be kept satisfied, and we realized that so much money had\nalready been put into the fleld that the investmont could not be\nJeopardized by ollowing 1t to deteriorate so that flying conditions\nwould be made hazardous or unreliable.\ntherefore, folt that\nany expenditures approved by us should to linited to Btrioti\nnon-permanent expenditures, which were nocessary for the operation\nand maintenance of the flel.de\nUpon your assurence that the field could be purchased, we\nalso approved certain other minor items of a permanent nature which\nwe felt necessary if the air field was to be properly improved.\nHowever, no items in the second and third categories, i. e.\ntial items\" and \"Desirable Items\" were approved.\n\"Essen-\nBefore the meeting of July 10th adjourned, I asked you if\nit would interfere with your plons 1f I got in touch with Ir. M1118\nand found out his attitude toward the sale or this land.\nYou etat-\ned you thought this would be very helpful.\nI explained to you that\nour Committee wanted a definite statement of the attitude of Mr.\nMills toward the disposition of this property.\nImmediately after this meeting I left on my vacation and did\nnot return for some two or three weeks, but upon my return I wrote\nto Mr. Ogden L. Mills, under date of August 2let, as follows:\nHon. Ogden Mills\nAssietent secretary of the Treasury\nWashington, D.
