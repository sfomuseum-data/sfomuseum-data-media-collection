      "Historic First Flights of Pan American Slippers\nPan American Jet Slipper departs New\nYork\nfor first scheduled jet passenger flight to Paris,\nOctober 26, 1958\nAmerican aviation enters the jet era as Pan Am Jet Clipper America (N711PA), commanded by Captain\nSamuel H. Miller, takes off from rain-soaked New York International Airport bound for Paris with 111 passengers.\nThis was the first scheduled commercial jet flight by a United States airline.\nThe Boeing B707 jet, flying at 575 miles an hour, reduced the crossing time • once 23 hours - to seven\nhours. With this flight Pan Am's Boeing B707s and Douglas DC-8s began leading the way in bringing the ad-\nvantages of jet travel to more than 80 lands around the world.\nLike no other aircraft that preceded it, the Jet Clippers shrunk the globe, putting any point on the earth's sur-\nface within 24 hours of any other point and boosting air traffic volume to new highs.\nAbout the Artist\nIn 1926, John T. McCoy became a working student for the Curtiss Flying Ser-\nvice, Curtiss Field, Long Island, New York.\nWhen Charles A. Lindbergh arrived at Curtiss Field, his SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS\nwas housed in one of the Curtiss hangars. It was at this time that McCoy met\nLindbergh, who was most cordial and friendly to those who worked on the flight\nline. In those days muscle power was the method used for starting engines, ac-\ncomplished by swinging the propeller by hand. McCoy often pulled a prop through\nfor Lindbergh.\nYears later, when McCoy was commissioned to do paintings depicting the\nhistory of Pan American World Airways, Inc. - entitled HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHTS\nOF PAN AMERICAN CLIPPERS - he consulted with Lindbergh on the selection of\naircraft and locations for the series.\nThis is one picture in a series of thirteen.
