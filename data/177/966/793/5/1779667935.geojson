The double-decked Boeing landed on a snow-covered runway built by a 'wintering-\nover' party laboring in temperatures as low as minus 68 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe Stratocruiser, a mainstay of Pan American's fleet during the 1950s, was a favorite of both flight crews\nand passengers. These aircraft logged an impressive 7,500,000,000 passenger miles before retiring to make way\nfor the new Jet Clippers.\nAbout the Artist\nIn 1926, John T. McCoy became a working student for the Curtiss Flying Ser-\nvice, Curtiss Field, Long Island, New York.\nWhen Charles A. Lindbergh arrived at Curtiss Field, his SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS\nwas housed in one of the Curtiss hangers. It was at this time that McCoy met\nLindbergh, who was most cordial and friendly to those who worked on the flight\nline. In those days muscle power was the method used for starting engines, ac-\ncomplished by swinging the propeller by hand. McCoy often pulled a prop through\nYears later, when McCoy was commissioned to do paintings depicting the\nhistory of Pan American World Airways, Inc. - entitled HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHTS\nOF PAN AMERICAN CLIPPERS - he consulted with Lindbergh on the selection of\naircraft and locations for the series.\nThis is one picture in a series of thirteen.
