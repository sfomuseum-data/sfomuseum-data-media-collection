The double-decked Boeing landed on a snow-covered runway built by a 'wintering-\nover' party laboring in temperatures as low as minus 68 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe Stratocruiser, a mainstay of Pan American's fleet during the 1950s, was a favorite of both flight crews\nand passengers.

In those days muscle power was the method used for starting engines, ac-\ncomplished by swinging the propeller by hand. McCoy often pulled a prop through\nYears later, when McCoy was commissioned to do paintings depicting the\nhistory of Pan American World Airways, Inc. - entitled HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHTS\nOF PAN AMERICAN CLIPPERS - he consulted with Lindbergh on the selection of\naircraft and locations for the series.\nThis is one picture in a series of thirteen.
