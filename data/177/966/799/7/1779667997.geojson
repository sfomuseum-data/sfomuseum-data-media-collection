      "Mistoric First Flights of Pan American Slippers\nDixie Slipper completes first transatlantic passenger flight\nNew York to Lisbon, Portugal,\nJune 29, 1939\nPan American's Dixie Clipper (NC18605) lands at Lisbon and becomes the first airplane to complete a\nscheduled transatlantic passenger flight. The Boeing B314, under command of Captain R. O. D. Sullivan with\nFirst Officers Gilbert, B. Blackmore and Robert D. Fordyce and a crew of nine, departed from Port Washington,\nNew York, the day before, flying via the Azores with 22 passengers.\nPan American's Boeing B314s served magnificently throughout World War II, transporting military person-\nnel and supplies to the war zones as well as carrying most of the leaders of the Allied Nations to important\nstrategic missions on all continents.\nAbout the Artist\nIn 1926, John T. McCoy became a working student for the Curtiss Flying Ser-\nvice, Curtiss Field, Long Island, New York.\nWhen Charles A. Lindbergh arrived at Curtiss Field, his SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS\nwas housed in one of the Curtiss hangars. It was at this time that McCoy met\nLindbergh, who was most cordial and friendly to those who worked on the flight\nline. In those days muscle power was the method used for starting engines, ac-\ncomplished by swinging the propeller by hand. McCoy often pulled a prop through\nfor Lindbergh.\nYears later, when McCoy was commissioned to do paintings depicting the\nhistory of Pan American World Airways, Inc. - entitled HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHTS\nOF PAN AMERICAN CLIPPERS - he consulted with Lindbergh on the selection of\naircraft and locations for the series.\nThis is one picture in a series of thirteen.
