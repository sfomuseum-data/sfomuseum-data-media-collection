      "TO SIT IN AN EXIT ROW\nIn order to ensure the fastest possible emergency\nevacuation, the Federal Aviation Administration has set\nstandards for people who sit in rows next to exits. Passen-\ngers sitting in exit rows must :\n1) Read English well enough to understand the\ninstructions for opening exits and for other emergency\nprocedures;\n2) See well enough to read these instructions, to see\nsignals given by crewmembers and to look outside for\ndangers such as smoke, fire or water which would make\nthe exit unusable. You can wear glasses or contact lenses;\n3) Hear well enough to understand English com-\nmands. You can use a hearing aid;\n4) Speak well enough to give information in English\nto crewmembers or other passengers during an emergency;\n5) Be able to use both hands, both arms and both\nlegs, as well as be strong and flexible enough to quickly\nopen the exit and go out through it. Be able to clear the\nexit row of obstructions. Some window hatches that must\nbe lifted can weigh as much as 65 pounds (30 kgs), the\naverage weight of a 7 year old child;\n6) Be willing to help other passengers away from the\nplane;\n7) Be at least 15 years of age;\n8) Be with no one that requires your care, such as a\nsmall child, or someone physically or mentally unable to\ncare for themselves.\nYou must be willing and able to do all of these things by\nyourself and without harming yourself.\nIf you cannot do all these things, you cannot sit in an\nexit row. If you are already seated there ask the flight\nattendant to move you to another seat. You do not have\nto explain why. You need to say only, \"I do not want to sit\nin an exit row.\"\nML-0476"
