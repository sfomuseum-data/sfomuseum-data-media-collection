Passengers should\nopen exits only if a flight attendant cannot reach the exit.\n1) Know where all the exits are on this aircraft.\nStudy the briefing card and know how to open the exit\nclosest to you.\n2) If an emergency evacuation is necessary, and if a\nflight attendant cannot get to the exit in your row, you may\nhave to open it. First, look outside. If fire, smoke, or\nwater could come into the cabin through the exit, don't\nopen it.\n3) If it is safe to open the exit, do so as quickly as\npossible. Keep the pathway to the exit clear. If the exit\ncannot be opened, go to another exit.\n4) If the exit has an inflatable emergency slide, you\nmay have to inflate it. Check the briefing card to see how.\nWhen it is inflated, shout \"Release seatbelts! Come this\nway!\" Then go out the exit as quickly as possible.\n5) If there is a slide, and there's no immediate dan-\nger, wait at the bottom to help people off the slide. Hold\nonto the slide to stabilize it.\n6) Move away from the aircraft as soon and as\nquickly as you can.\nThank you for your assistance\nin helping us meet these FAA requirements.\nMidway Airlines®\nWHAT FLYING SHOULD BE™\nCopyright © Interaction Research Corporation, 1990,\nTumwater, WA, USA.
