AT THAT TIME THE PRESENT UNUSED TOWER WAS ERECTED TO\nSUPPORT A HUGE WATER TANK.\nLATER THE BASE WAS USED by VARIOUS EARLY COMMERCIAL FLIERS and by the\nNEW YORK. RIO and BUENOS AIRES AIRLINE. IN 1930 PAN AMERICAN AIRWAYS TOOK OVER\nTHIS LINE and the BASE, and MOVED ITS OPERATIONS from the PAN AMERICAN LAND\nFIELD ON 36° ST. MIAMI. PAN AMERICAN BUILT the PRESENT STEEL BULKHEAD.\nADDING 13 ACRES, and RAISED the ENTIRE BASE THREE FEET HIGHER THE AIRPORT NOW\nCONTAINS 43 ACRES of LAND and ALMOST UNLIMITED AREAS in BISCAYNE BAY FOR\nTHE OPERATION OF THE GIANT FLYING BOATS.\nFOR THE FIRST TIME in HISTORY. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DREDGED\nHERE A CHANNEL FOR AIRCRAFT.AS the CLIPPER SHIPS DRAW 3 to 5 FT. of WATER. THIS\nCHANNEL, SHOWN by the MARKERS. IS 700 FT. WIDE and EXTENDS 1 MILE EASTWARD\nFROM THE TERMINAL BUILDING TO DEEPER WATERS Of BISCAYNE BAY.\nTHIS BASE IS CLOSER TO HAVANA 229 MILES) THAN TO DAYTONA.
