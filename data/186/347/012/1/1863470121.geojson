On this day in history, 100 years\nago, the Statue of Liberty was dedicated by President Grover Cleveland.

Sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi was commissioned to design the statue. With the assistance of Gustave Eiffel, who\ndesigned the iron framework and is better known for his later work \"The Eiffel Tower\", the statue was completed in France in\n1884. The cost of the statue was $400,000, which was paid for by contributions from the French people.\nThis unique statue was presented to the American Ambassador by the people of France on July 4, 1884, in recognition of\nthe friendship established between the two nations. In the summer of 1885, the Statue was dismantled into 350 individual\npieces and shipped to America on the French frigate \"Isére\" in 214 separate crates.\nIn August of 1885 the $270,000 needed to build the pedestal and re-assemble the statue was raised by the Ameri-\ncan people. The chosen site for the statue was Bedloe's Island, now known as Liberty Island. Construction of the pedestal\nwhich was designed by Richard Morris Hunt began soon thereafter and was completed in April of 1886.\nOn January 1, 1892, the Ellis Island Immigration Station opened and continued to operate until 1954 when it was de-\nclared surplus government property. Ellis Island, which lies nearby Liberty Island, was merely 3 acres of sand and silt that\nwas barely visible at high tide when it was bought by the U.S. Government in 1808. Today, Ellis Island is largely a man-made\nisland covering 27½ acres.\nOn October 15, 1924, the Statue of Liberty was declared a National Monument by Presidential Proclamation. In 1954,\nwork began to create a museum at the base of The Lady and in 1965 Ellis Island became a part of the Statue of Liberty\nNational Monument.\nThe watercolor on this menu was specially created for the celebration of the\n100th Anniversary of the Statue of Liberty by the world renowned artist, Dong\nKingman who was born in California and educated in Hong Kong. His watercolor\npaintings have graced more than forty major museums and numerous private collec-\ntions in the U.S.A. and abroad.",
