(It is now Sunday\nmorning and again I am flying down\nthe Yangtsze with Shanghai\nas our last stop.\nWe have just left Chekiang where the ship\nwhich we\nwere supposed to take back to Shanghai yesterday\npart to ward or and me den to lamen met us at there\nfloat - the engine is in bad shape and the plane will have to\nbe loaded on to a river boat and shipped back to Shanghai. The\nand mechanic will stay with the ship until it is loaded.\nI asked Norris\nto buy me some Chekiang china which is quite\nfamous and I\nthink very beautiful - it is called \"thousand\nflowers\"\nwrote to you about it once before.\nThe flowers\nare all different colors against a blueish gold back ground or\na black back ground.\nI ordered the lighter back ground and\nwill send one of the plates to\nyou for your approval or\ndisapproval.\nIf the latter, I can easily dispose of them in\nShanghai\nat more than Norris will pay for them.\nthought he\ncould get a fairly good set of six pieces each\nfor $60.00 Mex.\nor $15.00 our money.\nTo go on with my story of\nthe gorges -\nwe passed\nmany picturesque\njunks with their\ndelapidated sails,\nmiscelaneous cargos struggling up stream against\ncurrent and white capped\nrapids of the muddy snarling Yangtsze.\nA rope is attached to\nthe mast of the junk - a long long bamboo\ntwisted rope - trackers frequently stark naked strain with all\ntheir\nbare feet gripping the tow path worn\nsmoothe by\ngenerations of their sweating chanting grunting\nancestors who for thousands of years have fought up stream along\nsame path towing the same\ntype of cargo in the same kind\nof junks.\nThe latter vary in design so that experienced\nobservers can tell at a glance where the junk is from.\nof them will\ntravel from Shanghai\nto the borders of Tibet.\nplaces along the cliffs the tracker path is hewn out of solid\nrock and the trackers,\nfrom six to ten men depending on the\nsize of the tow,\ncling to\nthe narrow path with rock above their\nheads - one shoulder rubbing the cliff and the other above a\nyawning\nchasm 100 feet above the river where a slip means just",

(We have\njust\nlanded\nto deliver and take on mail at Anking - our station\nthere\nis\nin\nwhich\nraft like pontoon and attached to it is half a junk\nis\na waiting room.\nWe stayed there a few minutes and\nthen take\noff for Nanking.\nAnking.\nIt\nWe fly\nover the ancient city of\nis entirely surrounded by a high wall\nwith a moat.\nOne gate - is the only entrance on the river side and one on\nthe land\nside.\nWe have one Chinese passenger\nwho wakes up only\nto get out at each station and take a smoke.\nblue\ngown and a skull cap like Guido Pantaleoni wears) We\narrived\nat Hankow Friday afternoon - it was quite hot 88°\nthe shade and my winter suit was uncomfortable. Chilly's boy\npressed it for me which at least made it look more presentable.\nWe had dinner at Chilly's and then went to a movie \"Tomorrow\nand Tomorrow\".\nI had seen it before but didn't say so because\nthey all wanted to go and it was\nthe only movie in town.\nday A.M. we\nsaw Chilly off for Chungking again and\nSatur-\nwent shopping.\nI bought\nsome \"shorts\"\nwith stockings to match - olive drab -\nand felt much more comfortable - also felt (but\nwasn't) more\nconspicuous •\nWe had lunch at Chilly's place and as it was\nraining just sat around\nuntil\nthe plane, in\nwhich I am now\nwriting,\ncame in at 3 o'clock.\nThen we went\nout to the club\nand had\na swim after which we drank tea on the\nporch - watched\na cricket game \"just Iwancy\" and listened to a band, or rather\nwi th\n\"God\namid much bumping of glasses and\ntoasts - it was\nthe king's birthday - quite an event it seems among the English\nwho seem\nto control\nthe Hankow Club as\nwell\nas\nevery other\nclub in China except the American and French\nClubs at Shanghai.\nThe cricket\ngame was\nthe first I have ever seen and I found\nit much less boring than I expected - probably because one\nAmerican was playing and refused to make futile passes at the\nball but instead took a full man-sized baseball\nswing\nand\nknocked the ball out of the lot every time the \"bowler\" threw\nthe ball toward his wicket.\nAfter the American had\nscored\n45 runs the game was stopped for some reason - probably for tea\nor perhaps\nthey despaired of ever getting him out.\nHowever all\nthe Britishers gave him a great hand and didn't seem to resent",
      "- 4-\nhis breaking\nun-American\nup the game.\nin\nHe also was very modest and\nthe sense of the all too customary swash\nbuckling braggart type.\nAs a matter\nof fact the Chinese\nclassify all\nwhite men as \"foreigners\" and there is a\nresultant spirit of comradie which is quite refreshing and\naften you\nFrench\nentirely forget whether your companion is English,\nor\nwhat have you.\nWe are now approaching Nanking the present\nCapital of China.\nExcept for the immediate section around\nabout here and the recognition by foreign governments Nanking\nis a Capital\nallegiance\nin name only.\nThe far away provinces pledge\nthe National Government but they pay in practically\nno taxes\nand\nthe various generals (or bandits - until they win)\nfight it out for control.\nThey give nothing to,\nmontre anything to the National easily at Nant ne\nguess its about\nthe same as the U.S. in the\nlast analysis -\nexcept\nthe people of China do not have to put up with a Senate\nand Congress and you must admit that is one blessing which\nfar to\ngoes\nmake up for many hardships.\nOver here a man in public\nlife can\neat\nSwifts bacon without any\ndanger of impeachment for\nfavoring\nbig\nSenate\nI\nbusiness.\nWhen I read of the actions of the U.s.\ncan\nnot help but admire the Chinese system.\nHere at\nleast a leader of men must be a real man among his fellows - he\nmust possess a keen quick mind and a two fisted virility.\nOh\nwell\nanyhow Nanking.\nLeaving Nanking we have another passenger\nwho we learn from the station manager is Mr.\nChen, Police\nCommissioner of Hankow, formerly Police Commissioner at Shanghai.\nI'm told he lost his job at Shanghai because he caught the\nMayor smuggling opium at which job it seems the Mayor had been\nworking for several years quite\nto the advantage of said Mayor's\nbank account.\nMr. Mayor was given someother job and the Police\nCommissioner was\ntold to\nbe less zealous.\nI guess they were\nafraid he might get \"too high up on the hog\" as brother Bill says.\nWel\none - Our finst Chinese passenger just got a\nlittle touch of air sickness.\nAs Gent Shelton said of\nSpeed\nElliot - \"he is two\nshades whiter than a swan\".\nMust quit now.\nWe're approaching\nShanghai and\nI must pack up and really go back to hard work after\ninspection trip.\nLots and lots of love\nBix\nYound six lettres herr\nfrom you and the\nguls -\n# from you and\nthe Each from the gives."
