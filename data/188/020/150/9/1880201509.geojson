We left Chungking\n94 9 05\nand flew Bast through beautiful country very much\nlike Lake George except the broad Yangtze 1g coffee color\nrather toad one.\nChina is much more enjoyable from the air\nthan from the surface because you see only the beautiful\ngreen country and you miss all the squallor, dirt and most\nunpleasant of\nthe\nall,\nthe odors.\nSomeone was asked\nChinese National Anthem.\nhe\nragne ever heard the\nHe replied that at no place\nNational air but that he could smell it\nalmost anywhere.\nOur first landing was at Wahnsien which 1s\nquaint olty aw the upper end of une gorges.\nFrom there we\nflew close to the river through the gorges which rise steep\non either side from 500 to 1500 feet.\nThere we flew for a\nhundred miles about 30 feet off the water. (It is now Sunday\nmorning and again I am flying dow the Yangtze with Shanghai\nas our last stop,\nWe have just left Chekiang where the ship\nwhich we were supposed to take back to Shanghai yesterday\nmorning was forced down Friday afternoon by motor trouble.\nThe\npilot Howard Norris and mechanic \"Swede\" Larsen met us at the\nfloat - the engine is in bad shape and the plane will have to\nbe loaded on to a river boat and shipped back to Shanghai.\nThe\npilot and mochanio will stay with the ahip until.\nasked Norris\nto ouv me\nsome Chekiang chine\nit is loaded.\nwhich is quite\nramous and think very beautiful. - it is called \"thousand\nflowers\" and I wrote to you about it once before.. The ILOwers\nare all different colors against a blueish gold back ground or\nblack back ground.\nI ordered the lighter back ground and\nwill send one of the plates to you for your approval or\ndisapprovel.\nthe latter, I can easily dispose of them in\nShanghei at more than Norris will pay for them.\nHe thought he\ncould get a fairly good set of six pieces each for $60.00 Mex.\nor lb.00 our money.\nTo go\non with my story\nthe gorges\nwe passed many picturesque junks with their delapidated sails,\nmiscelaneous cargos struggling up stream against the swift\ncurrent and white capped rapids of the muddy snarling Yangtze.\nA rope 1s attached to the mast of the junk - a long long bamboo\ntwisted rope - trackers frequently stark naked strain with all\ntheir strength, their bere feet gripping the tow path worn\nsmoothe by generations of their sweating chanting grunting\nancestors who\nthe\nfor thousands of years have fought up stream along\nsame path towing the\ntype or cargo in the same Kind\nof junks.\nThe latter very in desion so that experienced\nOUSeMYOLIS con rela glance where the junk is from.\nбоне\nof them will travel from Shanghai to the borders of Tibet.\nAt\nplaces along the cliffs the tracker path is hew out of solid\nrock and the trackers, from six to ten men depending on the\nsize of the tow, cling to the narrow path with rock above their\nheads - one shoulder rubbing the cliff and the other above\nyawing chasm 100 feet above the river where a slip means just",
