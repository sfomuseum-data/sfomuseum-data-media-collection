(Any memo, short note\nor\nclub slip over here is a \"chit\")\nHe has a good Chinese boy\nas cook and another as\nservant - press suits, shine shoes, etc.\nWhen Chilly goes along\nthe river all the boats whistle a\nsalute\nand Chilly flashes the most engaging smile you've ever\nseen and waves to crew and passengers as he roars by.\nHe has\na stop at Ichang where\nthe gorges begin and there is\nstationed\nthe American \"flag-pan\"\nas the naval officers call the flag\nthe Yangtsze River flat bottomed gun boats.\nsanded on at on near t bottle an boo a am ral\ncalled out \"come on over Chilly\" so we got in a sampan and\njointed the officers on the Luzon,\nwhich is the \"flag-pans\"\nofficial name,\nand had a cup of\ncoffee and a sandwich while\nChilly's Chinese co-pilot Hugh Chen was supervising the\nrefueling of the ship.\nI noticed as we approached the flag\nship that all\nthe sailors and even the cook said \"Hello Chilly\".\nIf he gets stuck at Ichang, Chilly boards the Luzon with any\nforeign passengers he may have and spends the night on board\nflying on\nthe\nnext morning to\nChungking.\nIn two years he has\nnever had an accident of any kind and he is so well known\nthat his plane is filled to capacity on almost every trip.\nHe\nwrites notes to the foreign passengers and Chen writes notes\nto the Chinese\npassengers pointing out interesting places, etc.\nAt Chungking\nChilly had a flat but every time he arrived there\ndifferent people insisted on entertaining him and so he gave\nup his flat and for two years has stayed with friends up there.",

Chilly's boy\npressed it for me which at least made it look more presentable.\nWe had dinner at Chilly's and then went to a movie \"Tomorrow\nand Tomorrow\".\nI had seen it before but didn't say so because\nthey all wanted to go and it was\nthe only movie in town.\nday A.M. we\nsaw Chilly off for Chungking again and\nSatur-\nwent shopping.\nI bought\nsome \"shorts\"\nwith stockings to match - olive drab -\nand felt much more comfortable - also felt (but\nwasn't) more\nconspicuous •\nWe had lunch at Chilly's place and as it was\nraining just sat around\nuntil\nthe plane, in\nwhich I am now\nwriting,\ncame in at 3 o'clock.\nThen we went\nout to the club\nand had\na swim after which we drank tea on the\nporch - watched\na cricket game \"just Iwancy\" and listened to a band, or rather\nwi th\n\"God\namid much bumping of glasses and\ntoasts - it was\nthe king's birthday - quite an event it seems among the English\nwho seem\nto control\nthe Hankow Club as\nwell\nas\nevery other\nclub in China except the American and French\nClubs at Shanghai.\nThe cricket\ngame was\nthe first I have ever seen and I found\nit much less boring than I expected - probably because one\nAmerican was playing and refused to make futile passes at the\nball but instead took a full man-sized baseball\nswing\nand\nknocked the ball out of the lot every time the \"bowler\" threw\nthe ball toward his wicket.\nAfter the American had\nscored\n45 runs the game was stopped for some reason - probably for tea\nor perhaps\nthey despaired of ever getting him out.\nHowever all\nthe Britishers gave him a great hand and didn't seem to resent",
      "- 4-\nhis breaking\nun-American\nup the game.\nin\nHe also was very modest and\nthe sense of the all too customary swash\nbuckling braggart type.\nAs a matter\nof fact the Chinese\nclassify all\nwhite men as \"foreigners\" and there is a\nresultant spirit of comradie which is quite refreshing and\naften you\nFrench\nentirely forget whether your companion is English,\nor\nwhat have you.\nWe are now approaching Nanking the present\nCapital of China.\nExcept for the immediate section around\nabout here and the recognition by foreign governments Nanking\nis a Capital\nallegiance\nin name only.\nThe far away provinces pledge\nthe National Government but they pay in practically\nno taxes\nand\nthe various generals (or bandits - until they win)\nfight it out for control.\nThey give nothing to,\nmontre anything to the National easily at Nant ne\nguess its about\nthe same as the U.S. in the\nlast analysis -\nexcept\nthe people of China do not have to put up with a Senate\nand Congress and you must admit that is one blessing which\nfar to\ngoes\nmake up for many hardships.\nOver here a man in public\nlife can\neat\nSwifts bacon without any\ndanger of impeachment for\nfavoring\nbig\nSenate\nI\nbusiness.\nWhen I read of the actions of the U.s.\ncan\nnot help but admire the Chinese system.\nHere at\nleast a leader of men must be a real man among his fellows - he\nmust possess a keen quick mind and a two fisted virility.\nOh\nwell\nanyhow Nanking.\nLeaving Nanking we have another passenger\nwho we learn from the station manager is Mr.\nChen, Police\nCommissioner of Hankow, formerly Police Commissioner at Shanghai.\nI'm told he lost his job at Shanghai because he caught the\nMayor smuggling opium at which job it seems the Mayor had been\nworking for several years quite\nto the advantage of said Mayor's\nbank account.\nMr. Mayor was given someother job and the Police\nCommissioner was\ntold to\nbe less zealous.\nI guess they were\nafraid he might get \"too high up on the hog\" as brother Bill says.\nWel\none - Our finst Chinese passenger just got a\nlittle touch of air sickness.\nAs Gent Shelton said of\nSpeed\nElliot - \"he is two\nshades whiter than a swan\".\nMust quit now.\nWe're approaching\nShanghai and\nI must pack up and really go back to hard work after\ninspection trip.\nLots and lots of love\nBix\nYound six lettres herr\nfrom you and the\nguls -\n# from you and\nthe Each from the gives."
