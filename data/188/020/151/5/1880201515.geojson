(Any memo, short note\nor\nclub slip over here is a \"chit\")\nHe has a good Chinese boy\nas cook and another as\nservant - press suits, shine shoes, etc.\nWhen Chilly goes along\nthe river all the boats whistle a\nsalute\nand Chilly flashes the most engaging smile you've ever\nseen and waves to crew and passengers as he roars by.\nHe has\na stop at Ichang where\nthe gorges begin and there is\nstationed\nthe American \"flag-pan\"\nas the naval officers call the flag\nthe Yangtsze River flat bottomed gun boats.\nsanded on at on near t bottle an boo a am ral\ncalled out \"come on over Chilly\" so we got in a sampan and\njointed the officers on the Luzon,\nwhich is the \"flag-pans\"\nofficial name,\nand had a cup of\ncoffee and a sandwich while\nChilly's Chinese co-pilot Hugh Chen was supervising the\nrefueling of the ship.\nI noticed as we approached the flag\nship that all\nthe sailors and even the cook said \"Hello Chilly\".\nIf he gets stuck at Ichang, Chilly boards the Luzon with any\nforeign passengers he may have and spends the night on board\nflying on\nthe\nnext morning to\nChungking.\nIn two years he has\nnever had an accident of any kind and he is so well known\nthat his plane is filled to capacity on almost every trip.\nHe\nwrites notes to the foreign passengers and Chen writes notes\nto the Chinese\npassengers pointing out interesting places, etc.\nAt Chungking\nChilly had a flat but every time he arrived there\ndifferent people insisted on entertaining him and so he gave\nup his flat and for two years has stayed with friends up there.",
      "- 2-\nWell so much for Chilly - you may meet him\nbecause he is going home on leave in August and maybe to get\nmarried although he\nclaims his girl is still saying \"no\"\ninstead of \"yas\".\nHe has been over here 3 years and all\npilots get 3\nmonths home with expenses and full pay every\nHe says he wants to be back here by Xmas.\nWell to return to our flight.\nWe left Chungking\nat 9 A.M.\nand flew East through beautiful\ncountry very much\nlike Lake George except the broad Yangtsze is coffee color\nrather than blue.\nChina is much more enjoyable from the air\nthan from the\nsurface because\nyou see only the beautiful\ngreen country and you miss all the squallor, dirt and most\nunpleasant of\nSomeone was asked if he knew\nthe Chinese National Anthem.\nHe replied that at no\nhad he ever heard the National air but that he could smell it\nalmost anywhere.\nOur first landing was at\nWahnsien which is\na quaint city at the upper end of the gorges.\nFrom there we\nflew close to the river\nthrough the gorges which rise steep\non either side from 500 to 1500 feet.\nThere we flew for a\nhundred\nmiles about 30 feet off the water. (It is now Sunday\nmorning and again I am flying down\nthe Yangtsze with Shanghai\nas our last stop.\nWe have just left Chekiang where the ship\nwhich we\nwere supposed to take back to Shanghai yesterday\npart to ward or and me den to lamen met us at there\nfloat - the engine is in bad shape and the plane will have to\nbe loaded on to a river boat and shipped back to Shanghai. The\nand mechanic will stay with the ship until it is loaded.\nI asked Norris\nto buy me some Chekiang china which is quite\nfamous and I\nthink very beautiful - it is called \"thousand\nflowers\"\nwrote to you about it once before.\nThe flowers\nare all different colors against a blueish gold back ground or\na black back ground.\nI ordered the lighter back ground and\nwill send one of the plates to\nyou for your approval or\ndisapproval.\nIf the latter, I can easily dispose of them in\nShanghai\nat more than Norris will pay for them.\nthought he\ncould get a fairly good set of six pieces each\nfor $60.00 Mex.\nor $15.00 our money.\nTo go on with my story of\nthe gorges -\nwe passed\nmany picturesque\njunks with their\ndelapidated sails,\nmiscelaneous cargos struggling up stream against\ncurrent and white capped\nrapids of the muddy snarling Yangtsze.\nA rope is attached to\nthe mast of the junk - a long long bamboo\ntwisted rope - trackers frequently stark naked strain with all\ntheir\nbare feet gripping the tow path worn\nsmoothe by\ngenerations of their sweating chanting grunting\nancestors who for thousands of years have fought up stream along\nsame path towing the same\ntype of cargo in the same kind\nof junks.\nThe latter vary in design so that experienced\nobservers can tell at a glance where the junk is from.\nof them will\ntravel from Shanghai\nto the borders of Tibet.\nplaces along the cliffs the tracker path is hewn out of solid\nrock and the trackers,\nfrom six to ten men depending on the\nsize of the tow,\ncling to\nthe narrow path with rock above their\nheads - one shoulder rubbing the cliff and the other above a\nyawning\nchasm 100 feet above the river where a slip means just",

Chilly's boy\npressed it for me which at least made it look more presentable.\nWe had dinner at Chilly's and then went to a movie \"Tomorrow\nand Tomorrow\".\nI had seen it before but didn't say so because\nthey all wanted to go and it was\nthe only movie in town.\nday A.M. we\nsaw Chilly off for Chungking again and\nSatur-\nwent shopping.\nI bought\nsome \"shorts\"\nwith stockings to match - olive drab -\nand felt much more comfortable - also felt (but\nwasn't) more\nconspicuous •\nWe had lunch at Chilly's place and as it was\nraining just sat around\nuntil\nthe plane, in\nwhich I am now\nwriting,\ncame in at 3 o'clock.\nThen we went\nout to the club\nand had\na swim after which we drank tea on the\nporch - watched\na cricket game \"just Iwancy\" and listened to a band, or rather\nwi th\n\"God\namid much bumping of glasses and\ntoasts - it was\nthe king's birthday - quite an event it seems among the English\nwho seem\nto control\nthe Hankow Club as\nwell\nas\nevery other\nclub in China except the American and French\nClubs at Shanghai.\nThe cricket\ngame was\nthe first I have ever seen and I found\nit much less boring than I expected - probably because one\nAmerican was playing and refused to make futile passes at the\nball but instead took a full man-sized baseball\nswing\nand\nknocked the ball out of the lot every time the \"bowler\" threw\nthe ball toward his wicket.\nAfter the American had\nscored\n45 runs the game was stopped for some reason - probably for tea\nor perhaps\nthey despaired of ever getting him out.\nHowever all\nthe Britishers gave him a great hand and didn't seem to resent",
