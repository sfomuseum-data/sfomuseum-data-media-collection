It is always a matter of keen interest to the Pops' audiences\njust what golden nuggets Maestro Fiedler has mined from the vast field of so-called \"pop\" music.\nhe present collection represents some of the choice hits from current pop groups, movies and shows.\nThe title tune won the National Academy of Recording Arts \u0026 Sciences' accolade as the best song\nof 1967. In his arrangement Richard Hayman has caught the right free-wheeling spirit for the Pops'\nvin's rhythmically sophisticated and melodically tranquiliz\nng theme for the\nmovie \"Valley of the Dolls\" is followed by another movie title tune, the irrepressible Georgy Girl.\nIt is interesting to hear how easily the writing Beatles' (John Lennon and Paul McCartney) melodic\ninspiration, Yesterday, leads into the one purely classical piece on the record. Although everyone\nmay not be familiar with the title Andante from Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21, we will wager that\nno one who has seen the haunting him \" vira Madigan will soon forget it. The present recording of\nthe movement gains particular authenticity through the use of John Challis \"Mozart\" piano, the tone\nof which is a delicate combination of what we now know as piano and harpsichord tone. We are\nindebted to Newton Wayland for his excellent performance of the solo part and to Pine Manor\nJunior College of Brookline, Massachusetts, for the loan of the instrument.\nA truly stunning performance of the brash title tune from the Broadway smash \"Cabaret\" opens\nside z. then the beatles, who have made such a tremendous contribution through their whitng to\nraising the level of quality in popular music, are again saluted with Michelle.\nLove Is Blue and the affecting theme from one of France's most beautiful films, \"A Man and a\nWoman. bring us to A Lovers Concerto, which has a storv all its own. I was nirst taken with the\ntune when I heard Diana Ross and the Supremes' version of it. It sounded strangely familiar and\nterribly appropriate for Boston Pops treatment. When I played it for Arthur Fiedler he immediately\nknew wny: Or course, thats a vinuettrom J... baens wusical votebook for Anna Magdalena.\nAnd so, indeed, it is! A rather apt example of the increasing influence that classical music has in\nthe pop literature.\nSince Lara's Theme has become one of the all-time favorites with Boston Pops audiences, it is\nperhaps appropriate that we close with this radiantly romantic strain from \"Doctor Zhivago.\"\n-PETER DELLHEIM\n2009. 161. 004 a\nStereo LSC-3041\nside 1\nUp, Up and Away\nTheme Trom \"Valley of the Dolls\"\nGeorgy Girl\n\"Georgy Girl\")\n(Soriefeld Dale) rascap s.301\nYesterday\n(Lennon-McCartney (BMI 2:581\nMozart.
