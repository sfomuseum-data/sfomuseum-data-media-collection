So, it's no surprise that I would later\nbecome a chef, passionate about nutritious, wholesome\nand delicious foods.\nI started my culinary career about 15 years ago at Johnson\nand Wales University, and have worked at some of the\nfinest restaurants in the country.\nThough most of my mentors and training have been\nclassically French, my palate is still somewhat Latin and\nvery much American. When it comes to creating recipes,\nI believe less is more. I focus on freshness and seasonal\nfoods. I thoughtfully combine flavors that meld together\nbeautifully to give you a comforting dining experience\nthrough luxurious ingredients. I strive to make people\nhappy and content while experiencing my cuisine. I hope\nto make this journey a pleasant one for you.\nThank you for choosing Delta's BusinessElite so that I can\nexpress my gratitude in every bite you take.\nChef Michelle Bernstein\nWelcome Aboard\nWelcome aboard Delta's BusinessElite®, where your need for convenience,\ncomfort and premium service is recognized.
