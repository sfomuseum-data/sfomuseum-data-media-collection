It is hard to believe that time\nhas moved on so quickly. As a result of that program, red\nwine sales around the world started to increase dramatically\nana now actually outnumper white wine in many markets!\nThe whole premise of the show was that people living in the\nSouth of France were eating foods high in fat and cholesterol\nbut that statistically they were second only to Japan in the\nleast incidence of heart disease. Oh yes... the French drank\nwine every day and particularly red wine in that part of the\nworld. So the connection was made that maybe red wine\nhad something to do with these results.\nThere has been a significant amount of research conducted\nover the last 15 years trying to discover the compound in red\nwine that could be responsible for this paradox. This edition\nof our wine program will explore some of these concepts and\ngive you an insight into the scientific side of things while you\nsip on some of our wonderful selections.\nThis edition features a good mix of Old World and New World\nwines - from a North Eastern Italian Chardonnay to a great\nbig juicy Shiraz from Australia's Victoria region. The selections\nare very expressive, truly reflecting their variety, as well as\nbrilliantly complementing your choice of meal.\nEnjoy your flight with us today and happy travels.\nSalut,\nKen Chase\nWinemaker and Consultant.
