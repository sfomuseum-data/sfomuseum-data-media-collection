I thought those sites were\nunbelievable, and now at a frightening speed five years later web sites on wine\nnumber are in the ten thousands. Our goal was to bring you the best to make\nyour wine education more fun, especially if you travel a lot and sometimes find\nyourself stuck in a hotel with time on your hands. You could go on line and study\nwine all day long! There are now so many incredible sites for you to choose from;\na new one appears every day. As an educator this is music to my ears!\nHere are two great sites that you should bookmark.\nwww.wineeducation.org\nI like this site because it caters to both beginners and advanced students of the\ngrape. The site has been around for about eight years and takes a nice and easy\napproach to the joy of learning about wine. You get the sense that there is some\npassion behind this site.\nwww.drinkwine.com\nThis professionally done site has it all, from winery directories to travel in wine\ncountry. It is well laid out and easy to follow and read. Gives you wine clubs to\njoin and the latest news in the business. You can ask questions on wine and get\nanswers.
