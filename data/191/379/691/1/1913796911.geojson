March 6th\n1958\nDear Girlst.\nI\ncame up here for a meting of PAA on the 4th and\nan staying\nover for\na meeting of GPU on the 10th - meanwhile engaging in that pleasant\ntask which\nUncle San reserves for his nephews of making out my income tax.\nIn my odd moments will try to give you a brief\nrun down on our\nrecent trip\naround So. America.\nThe Director's flight left N.Y.\non the\n7th of Feb. with the first stop Havana where Ma and I joined\nthem. We left\nthere on the 9th and\nafter a four hour flight arrived at Curacoa in the\nDutch B West Indies.\nThere PAA built a most attractive hotel on the founda-\ntion of an old fort which guarded the entrance to the harbor.\nIt was sunday\nbut they kept the stores open to the delight of the women and dismay of the\nmen on\nthe trip. On the 10th we made a 72 hour flight across Columbia and a\npart of Venzuela to Lima, Peru.\nto Cuzco in a Panagra D03.\nThe next morning some of our party flew up\nand of course\nPa an unpressurized tene ve a to have ye ero this van es\nsupplied through outlets at each seat and we all wore masks -\nlooking for all\nthe world like a lot of horses at chow time.\nSome\nof the\nparty did not go\nTo tell\nthe truth I\nwas too but didn't say\nabout it.\nReminded me of old man\nBall when he took delivery of his first airplane he told the pilot to climb\nto 10,000 feet.\nThe pilot objected because\nthey had to make El\nPaso before\ndark but Mr. Ball insisted.\nThe pilot climbed up to 10,000 and coasted on in\nto El Paso.\nThere he asked again why the old man insisted and Mr.\nBall\nsaid\n\"I\ndont mind telling you now.\nThe doctor said if I went up to 7,500 feet\nthat I would drop dead so I just spotted him 2,500\nfeet to\nprove that he did\nnot know what the H\nhe was talking about.\"\nWe loved Cuzco\nand neither of\nus felt the altitude at all.\nOf course the thing that interested me most was\nthe stone walls that the old Incas built.\nSome of the\nstones weigh 20 or\n30,000 lbs. were moved as much as a mile and\nare so close together that you\ncant put a knife blade between them at any point of the 7 foot joint.\nThis\nthey did without steel chisels - no\none knows just how. We stayed\novernight\nand the next morning flew back to Lima.\nOn the 13th we flew 7 hours along\nthe coast of Peru and Chili with the unending blue Pacific on our right and\nthe snow capped Andes on the left.\nIt was a magnificent flight.\nWe\nspent\nthat night and the next in Santiago and on the 15th flew over the highest\nmountain in this hemisphere and then circled\ndown in a valley to 15,000 feet\nwhere we had a good look at the Christ of the Andes.\nAfter about three hours\nwe landed at Bariloche in the Chilean Lake country.\nActually we were just\nover\nthe Chilean border in Argentina some 450 miles south and\nwest of B.A.\nThe lake was sonething like Lake George - the water as blue - but the mount-\nains all around\nand mostly snow capped.\nof course in their\nves rese At the rattle hotel where we stayed ave\nWe were there\nsumner.\nTrippe\nhad us all in a little room off the bar for drinks before dinner.\nSomeone\ntapped me on\nthe shoulder and when I\nturned around\nthere was wes\nShapleigh.\nThe Ss,\nDanforths,\nStuarts and Whitesides all old friends from St. Louis\nwere on a trip around\nSouth America.\nIt was as though you'd\nrun into an old\nfriend at Lake Pharoah.. Frank Gledhill\nand I\ngot up\nearly the next morning\nand went fishing.\nWe were only out about an hour but he caught an 8 lb.\nrainbow trout.\nWe had lunch at a private home on the edge of the lake which",
