Bixby\n\"Topside\"\nBolton Landing, New York\nDear Harold -\nThe Florida Supreme Court seems to be in no hurry to rule\non the\nSanibel causeway bond case.\nWill let you know as soon\nas they rule.\nWhen I last saw you we discussed the possibility of including\na piece of privately owned property in the proposed Sanibel wild-\nlife preserve.\nThis chunk of\nland contains about 234 acres and it\nis in Sec.\n17, T 46 S - R 22 E, and is surrounded by state and\nFederal lands.\nIt is owned by\ntwo separate parties and is listed\nfor\nsale it $350 per acre with the Sanibel-Captiva Real Estate\nhere.\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the president of the\nFlorida Audubon Society - Mr. John Storer, Under Mountain Road,\nSheffield, Mass.\nI believe the Society has some detailed maps of\nthe area we prepared some time ago.\nMr. Storer has been our contact\nwith the\nI. I. Board in the matter of setting aside some 2,000 acres\nof these wet\nlands for a permanent wildlife preserve.\nPerhaps Mr. Storer has already considered how these privately\nowned lands in\nSec. 17 might be included in the preserve.\nHe has\nbeen most helpful all the way on the\nproposa\nand is experienced in\nsetting up projects of this kind.\nI an asking him to write you on\nthe subject.\nFrom the map it seems you are almost summer neighbors.\nWe are\nexpecting our three grandsons here next week for a visit.\nNever a dull moment then.\nin sending best greetings\nto you and Mrs. Bixby.\nThanks for the good wishes.\nSincerely,\nWilli, Conles\nP.S.\nThe Signet book I am sending you portrays more than i can\nsay about the author.\nMr. and Mrs. Storer are very fine people.\n26BC",
