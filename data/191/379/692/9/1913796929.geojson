Ferguson, Chairman\nTrustees Internal\nImprovement Board\nTallahassee, Florida\nDear Mr. Ferguson:\nYou probably do not remember me because there is no reason why\nyou should but I remember you very well because of the really\nconstructive help you gave us on\nCaptiva when we were strugling\nwith erosion problems.\nAs one of the Commissioners of the Cap-\ntiva Erosion Prevention District I am happy to tell you that we\nhave completed our program\nand it is attracting wide-spread int-\nerest - in fact a similar installation is now under construction\non Long Island, New York.\nThe purpose of this letter is to express the hope that you will\nuse your influence to bring about the creation of the Jay N.\n\"Ding\"\nDarling Wild Life Sanctuary on Sanibel,\nThe so called \"land\" in\nthis area is really nothing more than a myriad of tiny\nmangrove\ncovered islands set in tidal shallows - ideal for a wading bird\nand wild life sanctuary but of little value for any other purpose.\nI understand that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are willing\nto spend a substantial amount for surveys, deep wells, board walks\nand other facilities to make this area into a wildlife sanctuary\nof national importance.\nThey ask only a lease for a time\nsufficient\nto justify the\nrather large sun required.\nThey are willing to\naccept a cancellation of the lease if the area is not used\nby them\nas a wildlife sanctuary. The State has everything to gain and no-\nthing to lose.\nI met \"Ding\" Darling when I first went to Captiva nearly\ntwenty years\nHe often talked of a sanctuary on Sanibel.\nNothing would\nplease him more\nthan to have his name associated with this sanctuary.\nFor Florida no name would be more of an attraction for \"Ding\" had a\nnation-wide audience many of whom knew him and all of whom admired\nhim as a truly great American.\nVery sincerely\nHarold M. Bixby",
