Bryant. However, I\ndoubt that he could do as good a job of it as you did in your\nsplendid letters of August 20th and Sept. 4th. It seens such\na shame to have the ball on the one yard line and not score.\nI had hoped that I might get away and\npossibly hang sround\nthe Statehouse at Tallchassee for a few days even though such\nprocedure is completely out of\ncharacter for me but it hasn't\nworked\nout.\nlet's hope that your letters will carry that ball soross!\nAll the best to you and Dick always\nAs ever",
