    "media:imagetext": "Honolulu, November 13th '63\nDear F and F (Family \u0026 Friends)\nWe took off for London at 9 a.m. on Oct. 30th. Our old friends\nChili Vaughn and 0. F.\nStudeman both former pilots who are now executives\ncame over to the\nClipper lounge to see us off.\nChili said that we would\nfly South of hurricane\nGinny and thus pick up a strong tail wind as hurri-\ncanes turn counter-clock wise.\nShortly after take off the Captain gave our estimated flight time\nto London as 6:20, actually by my watch,\ntake off\nto touch down was 6:19.\nIt is amazing how close the jets\ncome to forecast or perhaps I should say\nthe forecasts to the jets.\nOf course they climb up above the weather so\nyour flight is smooth all the way.\nWe stayed at a little hotel in London called the Goring on Ebury\nStreet near Buckingham Palace.\nThe hotel is more than 50 years old and\nboasts of\nbeing the first hotel in the world to have a bath with every room,\nthe baths have changed very little in those fifty years.\nBut the beds are\ncomfortable, the service perfect, the rates reasonable and the food delicious.\nOn the 31st we had lunch at the Cog d'or with our old friend\nJack Kelly, PAA Vice-President for Europe.\nThat night we saw Lawrence of\nArabia - as Debby's father used to say of\nsome sermons - it could be condensed.\nSaturday, November 2nd, we hired a car and drove down toward Hastings\nto see our old friend Susan McCrindle.\nHer husband Ronald was in N. Y.\nwas one of the top men in B.O.A.C. for many years.\nWe loved the drive through\nthe English country side\nand Kent is especially beautiful.\nThe McCrindles\nhave a house built in 1766 with part of an old Moat around it.\nSunday, our old friends from Shanghai, Col. and Mrs. Wilfred Clark,\ncame up from Farnsborough to have lunch with us and we also had her blind son\nMike Alymer, his wife and little girl.\nThat morning we walked over to Hyde Park to see the start of the\nantique cars racing to Brighton.\nThere were 250 entries from all over the\nworld and all cars were made prior to 1905.\nThe drivers and passengers\nwore costumes of that time, deer-stalker hats, dusters and the lady's big\nhats with veils.\nof\ncourse most of them do not finish the 50 mile drive in\nthe four hours allowed by the rules.\nWe left London at 10 a.m. on November 5th and again\nthe elapsed\ntime of the flight was forecast to\nthe minute.\nDebby and I had both read\nquite a few books about the 400 year search for the N. W. Passage including\na book\nby Henry Cooper's brother, Paul, which dealt with the disappearance\nof Sir John Franklin.\nWe recognized many of the names of islands, capes\nand sounds as we passed over Hudson Bay.\nIt seems hard to believe but we\ndid the 5,514 miles from London to Los Angeles in just a little bit less\nthan half a day including a brief refueling stop at Winnepeg.",
