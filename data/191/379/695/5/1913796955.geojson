Pac\" which sounas\nas though it might be short for \"Prana-Pacifio\" ocerates only from Noumea to the\nIsle de Fine.\n\"Dragon Rapide\", a two engined Bi-plane with so many gadgets and gimmicke that we\nused to say it had a \"built in bead kind\".\nThe beach at the Isle of Pines de magnificent, clean, firmly packed white\nsand gently sloping towerd and into a lana locked lagoon where the water is clear\nas crystal.\nWe are in one of ter native huts with heavily thatched roof and mat\nsides but nard wood floors,\nelectric lights and tiled bath.\nVery attractive and\nright on the beach.\nIts unkind to write this but we are having the kind of\nweather I like- when you are never cold.\naveryone dresses sensibly.\nI suppose\nwe men are indebted to Douglas No√Ñrtaur for the open neck-no necktie style.\nPractically no one wears a coat.\nThe Grand Pacifio Hotel in Suva suggested that\nsleeved shirts.\nThe only ones who do not dress appropiately for the hot olimate\none wrapped around them full length with\nThe men wrap themselves up\nin a lavu-lavu, a sort of aloth wound tightly around their waist extending below\ntheir knees.\nDec. 14th.\n1053 and shortly afterward they made it into a prison.\nThe temperature ranges\norime such as occured in the little town of lake George when a well intentioned\nShe\nprovided beauty reat mattresses, antle deep rugs, chintz curtains and eleotrio\nblankets. A special chef provided steaks, roast beef, eto., Never has there been\nsuch a percenta de increase in crime.\nBums came from miles around to shy a brick\nthrough a window and then stand around tobe arrested and serve a six months\nsentence.\nThey could get another six nonths by telling the judge they hoped when he\ngot home his moter would come out from under the porch and bite him. It must\nhave been something like that in France except that the condemned might be sent to\nDevil's Island instead of here. Debby and I bave found 20 different kinds of\nshells on the beach here.\nSaturday afternoon, Deo, 14th. Debby and I have just returned from an ex-\nparience which could only take place in Prench territory.\nYesterday there were\nonly a few people here but today around lunch time they started moving in from\nevery direction. Debby had been talking alot with a young Frenchman who has been\ndiving for shells ano has at least one quite valuable one. We had been talling to\nhim about a trip out to a reef where we might find some better suells. He suggested\net lunch time that we go out at 2:30 so at that time Deb and I went down in front\nof the bentral eating place where he keeps the boat and got in expecting him to\ntake off right away.\nThe boat is about the size of Joe Barker's, perhaps 15 feet\nLong with 2.45 H.P. Evinrude outboara engines.\nAfter Debby and I waited for the\nFrenohman to\nleave and he cept looking shoreward expectantly, a very dizzy brunette\nsot in and then a bus load of people arrived and started boarding our boat like\nalot of pirates.\nwhen they all got in, believe it or not, we counted 18 grown ups\nand 9 children. If there was a life preserver on board it was not in evidence.\nThe\nskipper could not look ahead because of the congestion on the front deck so he\nstood on the funnel to spot the reefs, and there were plenty of them, reaching in\nto steer the boat now and then.\nWe went quite a long way to a small island where'\neverybody went ashore in two feet of water.\nDee. 15th.\nBack in Wounea. We're getting a bit fed up with the gol darn\nPrench.\nThey remind me alot of the Chinese- sonehow or other order eventually\nflows from what appears to be utter and hopeless confusion.\nThis afternoon we got",
