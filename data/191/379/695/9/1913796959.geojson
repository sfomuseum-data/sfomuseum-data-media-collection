    "media:imagetext": "Sydney, Dec., 19, 1963\nDear F and P.\nWe had quite a typical French departure from Noumea.\nThe TAI large bus called\nfor us at Les Bungalows promptly at 2:30 in the afternoon and then made other stops\non the road into town. The French and Australians piling on at each stop with\nbundles, babies, baskets and blankets in a welter of confusion.\nEventually we\narrived at the TAI city office where there ensued a long unexplained delay.\nin official announced in rapid fire French and then in halting English that the air-\nplane was having mechanical trouble and we would wait there to see whether or not\nwe'd fly. After an hour more all the French began scrambling back on the bus and\nsomeone said \" We're Going\".\nThe drive to the airport, 30 miles, was magnificent.\nWhen we got there all was confusion compounded. There must have been 300 people in\nand around the small station with baggage scattered all over the place. It reminded\nme of the time Bondy and I left Nanking for Hankow during the war.\nWe took an over\ncrowded lighter out to the steamer in mid river.\nYou cannot possibly conceive of\nsuch confusion.\nEach coolie trying to out screech the others.\nBondy reassured one\nAmerican inexperienced traveler who had 17 different pieces of baggage that out of\nthat bedlam would come order and he'd find all 17 pieces in his stateroom.\nseemed like a thousand to one shot but that is just what happened to our friend and\nalso to ud. So it was with the French in Tantouta airport at Noumea.\nit all straightened out, we got on the airplane, a Douglas DC \u0026 Jet, and we had a, /\nvery comfortable flight to Sydney.\nHowever, I am glad to be away from the French.\nThe PAA #1 in Australia, Rush Clark, met us at the airport, whisked us through\ncustoms, and drove us into the new Nenzirs Hotel, after going by his office to pick\nup our mail.\nDebby and I had a late snack and read our mail, a real treat.\nday, Wed. the 18th, I had lunch at the American Club with Rush Clark and Debby\nlunched with his wife.\nThen that evening we all had drinks at Sir Hudson and Lady\nFysh's apartment after which they gave us a super dinner at a restaurant on Rose Bay\nwhere the old flying boats used to base. Hudson Fysh is an old World War I pilot\nwho was born in Tasmania and came back here after the war to start Quantas which has\ngrown to be one of the largest airlines in the world. He and I served together on\nthe Executive Committee of IATA. He is plenty sharp- as evidence - we used to agree\non almost ever later a are F for Calmes en route Taursday Island, Of\ncourse everything here is backwards - as we go north it gets hotter and we plan to\ntravel light leaving our suit cases here at the hotel.\nWe go out on the Great\nBarrier Reef from Cairnes to Green Island for Sat. and Sunday the 21st and 22nd.\nThen on the 23rd we fly from Cairnes to Thursday.\nDec. 23rd. It didn't work out that way.\nWhen we arrived at Cairnes it seemed\nbest to make some changes in our plans. It would have been fun to have our Chrietmas\non Thursday Island but on the other hand we did not want to become a burden to\nâ€¢Dabby's friend Reg Soott.\nSo we phoned him on the day after our arrival here (Dec.21)\nand cleared a program to fly up there on the 26th arriving about 4:30 in the after-\nnoon and come back here on the 27th. Meanwhile we learned two things. One,Green\nIsland wassfull up for the holidays and couldn't take us, and two, that is is a park\nwhere it is against the law to do any shelling. So we stayed in the Great Northern\nat Cairnes.\nSunday the 22nd we took a boat - with about 100 other passengers - out the 17\nmiles to Green Island on the Great BarrieR. Reef.\nIt is a beautiful coral island\nof some 30 acres entirely surrounded by coral reefs. We took a glass bottomed boat\ntrip. Looked at the world famous under water museum and enjoyed ourselves - but no\nshelling. Then today we got a drive U.R. self Holden (General Motors) and drove on\nthe wrong side of the road 50 miles up the coast to the small town of Port Douglas\nwhere a shell merchant by the name of Tom Scullett has quite a collection. He had\nbean recommended by a collector on Piji. Debby bought quite a few shells and\nestablished a good contact for future acquisitions. While she was talking shells I\nroamed aound town (which didn't take long) and talied to some old timers in front\nof a \"Pub\". They told me that at one time there were 17 Pubs on the main street\nwhere now there was only this one.\nIn their minds it was clear that civic importance\nwas measured in terms of the number of pubs. All this talk about pubs reminds me of",
