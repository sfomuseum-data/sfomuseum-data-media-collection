    "media:imagetext": "-2-\nthe time i had the honor of being President of the S.P.C.A., an organization which had\nlittle to do with kindness to animals, the initials stood for the Shanghai Pub\nCrawlers Association.\nIt seems that in the old days produce of the interior of North\nqueensland moved over rough roads by bullook drawn carts which descended from the\n\"Table Land\" to the Port of Douglas.\nThen came the rail road to Cairnes and that\nwas the end of Port Douglas. As you get around the world it is rather sad to see\nhow changes beyond the control of the individual erode values.\nI remember when Id\nqueeney of Monsanto Chemical said that one of the dad effects of chemical research\nwas the damage done to some old established businesses such, for example, as the\nleather trade or sponge divers. This reation is evident in the local economy\nwhere the formerly important pearl button industry has been almost wholly, supplanted\nby plastios.\nAs a result the Queensland government had been experimenting with the\nculture of artifioial pearls. They have haddquite a bit of help from the Japanese\nin return for which technical assistance the Japs take over the marketing of the\npearls, at which, they are most experienced and I suspect reap the largest share of\nthe profit.\nOne of the fringe benefits of our travels in the tropios has been the Paw Paws\nor Papayas. For 30 years I have tried in vain to like them but not until this trip\ndid I succeed. Also the Australian Mangos are as good as we have ever tasted.\nDeo. 29%h. This year Christnes for us is just the 25th of Begember, but we're\nneither homesick or unhappy. Yesterday we hired a car and driver and motored up\nto the Table Lands about 1200 feet higher than Cairnes which of course is a sea level\nport and at sea level. We saw \"the most beautiful rail road station in the world\"\nand by golly it lived up to its billing. The station itself was much like any other\nAmerican station with tracks on either side but the entire 150 - 200 foot length was\ndone quite a bit of prospecting. He told us all about the old days before the rail\nroad, the bullock carts and the early pioneers of whom his father was one. He asked\nhim about the aborigines, whom he called \"abos\", who are much more in evidence in\nthis part of Australia than elsewbere. I told him that Capt. Cook had to put in to\nshore for pepairs\nto his ship just notth of here and was much surprised to find no\nnatives at all nor did any come around for the whole three months he was there. Our\ndriver said that was because the abos lived up on the Table Land where they lead a\nnomadic life following the game and fishing in the numerous streams.\nIn fact he\nsaid that one quite intelligent abo said to him\" You know, sir, you white people\nare making real progress - you do not work as hard as your father did and he in turn\ndid not work as hard as his father.\nWith us it is just the reverse. My grandfather\ndidn't do any work at all.\nHe had a good life. Then when the white man came my\nfather had to work, he\ncouldn't just nove around hunting and fishing.\nThen I came\nalong and I have to work much harder than my father did. We abos are sliding back\nas fast as you whites are going ahead.\"\nDed. 26th, En route Cairns - Thursday Island. We are flying in a twin engined\nFokker along the coast with the Great Barrier Reef clearly marked off, to our right\nship - is off to our right.\nof the great naval\nengagements of World War II was fought. We were sort of hoping to\nfly over to Papua and New Guinea. We had heard that up in the mountains at a place\ncalled Goroka there would be a big gathering of tribesmen and a most interesting show.\nWe actually applied for a permit to fly to Port Morenby but we then learned that the\nbie pow pow of natives had been called off and that we might have alot of trouble\nsecuring permits to go beyond Port Moresby because of trouble with Sukarno over the\nborder between Australia and Indonesia. While there may be no real trouble you can\nsure get plenty of run around from the bureaucrats who control the granting of travel\npermits.\nSo tonight we'll be with Debby's friend Reg Seott and tomorrow we'll fly as\nfar as Hockhampton.\nIt would have been intensely interesting to see the areas in New\nGuinea where B1ll Hawkins spent so much time during\nthe war and perhaps get over to\nRabaul and the Solonon Islands where Bill Barrett operated his P.T. boat so effectively\nbut that will have to wait.",
