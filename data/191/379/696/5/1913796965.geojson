    "media:imagetext": "Ded. 27th. En route south from Thursday Island. We arrived at Thursd y which\nis about twice as big as blay Island or actually two miles around. Debby's friend Ree\ngott net us and escorted us to the Grand Hotel on a slight rise about the harbor.\nfur room was on the second floor resched from an open porch. It had a large door\nopening on to the porch but no other ventilation whatever and it was hot.\nThursday\nIsland is just a little more than 10 degrees below the equator. Reg told us that\nGrand boasts of\nsale\". However, the toilet for men, such as it was, was at the end of the long\nwooden porch and the ladies around the corner from there.\nWe left these sumptious\nsurroundings at once and went to Reg's house by taxi. It is on a hill side over\nLooking the harbor.\nWe met Mr.s Scott, very cordial and nice and their little girl\nge 5, quite cute. Nrs. Scott busied herself with getting dinner while Debby and\nReg started looking over drawer after drawer of fine shells, many quite rare. He\nlet her buy anything she wanted except two or three he wanted to keep for one\nreason or anther.\nDinner was announced at 7 P.M. and we had perfectly delicious\nin how with et potatoes\nReg had shot the deer a few days ago within sight of\nus a picture of two wild pigs which he had shot.\nApparently with a large deep freeze filled with venison, wild pig and mackerel the â€¢\nscott Tamily pretty much lives off; the lanu. Kiter dinner Reg and Debby looked at\nshells until 11 P.M., agreed on a selection, got together on cost and he agreed to\npack and ship to Captiva.\nThe scotts, husband and wife, couldn't have been nicer\noR more hospitable.\nHe walked down to the hotel with us and we said our au revoirs.\nIt was \"Caberet\" night at the Grand. Alot of pretty rough looking sustomers, black,\nwhite and brown were dringing beer and dancing to the music of a three man orchestra\nwhose playing xax made up in sound for what it lacked in quality. In our room on\nthe second floor balcony we haddall the privacy of the proverbial gold fish for we\ncouldn't close our door without suffocating.\nHowever, the music or should I say\nnoise, abated around midnight and we slept until called at 6 a.m. to catch the\nplane on which I am writing now. So Thursday Island has come and gone. It was two ya\nyeurs ago that Debby got a letter from Reg Soott in which he said that he wanted\nto sell his collection.\nI said \"Why don't you buy it?\" and Deb said \"I wouldn't\nwant to buy any part of it without seeing it\" so I said \"Let's go look at it \". \"We\ncan't do that\" said Deb and I said \"why not?\" nd here we are, mission secomplished.\nDebte bap one voing sultand very are helpe to the torer nonetion anie the\nquite happy.\ncenter of an almost unlimited supply of bauxite, the ore used to produce aluminum.\nto produce aluminum economically.\nwhere we he ve a four hour stopover before taking a larger and faster Viscount\nto Rockhampton.\nI'll get this off from Cairns as it is already too long. We'll probably\nat doveral day of tell eaten on ned ore bit to tee trend Barine tor and\nnumber of shell dealers who have been highly recommended.\ntrain or bus.\nof that travel might be a little rough for us old folks. Anyway, our address until\nty next letter will be care of PAA, 82 Elizabeth St., Sydney.\nMay '64 bring you more - of everything you want.\nHarold",
