It is British but nearly everybady on the island\nspeaks French and most of the inhabitanta are Indians. The econony is tied to sugar\nand they produce\n600,000 tons in a good year.\nAs in the case of Piji it is\nonly a question of time before the Indians take over for they make up some 75% of the\npopulation and of course as elsewhere are multiplying like rabbits.\nPersonally I\nhave a very low opinion\nof the Indians sturting out with Mr. Neuru.\nThey live in\nabsplute squalor with\nseldon ary attempt at either cleanliness or beauty.\nNever a\ntover for la piot of \"rass\narowd their miserable. shacks?\nThey are dirty, cowardly.\nmossly inefficient, deceitful and arrogant when they have a chance to be.\nIn\nother words I do not admire them.\nThere are exceptions of course but I just have\nnever run into one.\nthere vere no natives. The island was uninhabited until the Dutch took it over in\n598 but they moved away in 1710 and five years later the French took over and\nremained until the British captured it in 1014 and have held it ever since.\nThe\nisland is famous as the home and the only one of the Dodo bird.\nAll my life I've\nbeard of thattbird but never knew what it was.\nIt seems\nthat the Dodo - sort of\nlike an over sized duck\ncouldn't fly, in faot it couldn't even run.\nAs a result\nall the Dodos were killed off by the first Dutch aettlers and there are no more.\nAlso Aud Whittenore and othor stamp collectors know of a very famous and now\nexpensive stamp that was produced in 1847 and had on it by mistake \"Post Office\"\ninstead of \"Post Paid\".\nJohannesburg, Jan.\n7th\nLeaving Mauritius we flew over Reunion, a small\nisland which flies the French flas, then over Madagascar which is the fourth largest\nisland in the world.\nContinuing across to the African coast, we flew over Lourenco\nKaroues in Portuguese Mozambique. It was there that the Gripsholm exchanged\nmerican refugees for Japanese. I remenber my old time secretary, Miss Forbes, who\nworked for the State Dept. after we left China and was interned for several months\nin a Japanese prison camp.\nshe said that after a diet of rice three times a day\nthat night the the no peno looking forward to done, very fancy dessert on the\neat nicht aboard the Gripsholm.\nOur plans nave jelled.\nTonorrow horning, Hea. Jan. 8 we are driving to the\nKruger National Park returning Friday the 10th.\nThen on Saturday the 1lth we are\ncoing to have lunch with Mr. and Mrs. Boswell at their beautiful ranch type home\nyour Pretoria. Debby had been told about her shell collection by a man in Rockhampton,\nAustralia and phoned her when we arrived sere. The result was a trip down there this\nmorning.\nWe really felt like intruders to walk in like that but we found them both\nnost delightful and she,\nwho nad never sold a shell before, sold Debby a great many\nduplicates from her marvelous collection and after a couple of hours we came away\nLoaded.\nDebby was as happy\nas a missionary who had just converted a whole tribe.\nThis afternoon Mrs.\nBoswell telephoned to ask us down for Saturday with Mr. Bosewll\noalling for us and driving us home, a distance of 20 miles each way. So you can see\ntust Debby really made another convert.\nput on a dance.\nor rather under the city of Johannesburg. The mines bring in natives right out of the",
