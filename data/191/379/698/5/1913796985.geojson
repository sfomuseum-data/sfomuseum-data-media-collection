Dea.\n2.\nWe started early with an Inglish speaking driver\nwho had\npreviously taken us to Biblos and drove north the whole\nlength\nLebanon nonth of here and crossed into Syzia to visit\nthe\nlargest and best preserved of all the Czusaders castles\naalled\nTeak des Chevaliers. Going there we drows along the\nbaautiful\n- the\n21.00\ncontzast to the shirt-sleeve weather of the coast. Dense\norange\ngroves with the trees just loaded with nearly ripe\noranges,\norohards of fig trees, banana plantations all enjoying\nthe tropical sun shine along with us.\nMore delny and trouble\nat the Syrian frontiez. Our visas vere for a sángle trip and\nthis\nwas 12.\nWe had to pay 20 Syrian pounde (about 36.00) and\nI notioed that no entry was made in our passports. I doubt 11\nthe syrian equivalent of Seoretary of the Treasuy Dillon ever\nsaw any of\nthose pounds.\nThe casite can only be appreciated by\nseeing it and going through it. Neither of us realised before\nthis trip hou long the Crusaders vere in this part of the world.\nKrak des Chavaliers wes hold by them for more than 150 years.\nDuring\nthat time they were constantly making it stronger. I$\nstands on\nthe top of a zooky eminence in a fertile valleyt\nperhaps 400 feet above the valley floor.\nIt consists of a deep\nmost all the way around, then an outer wall trenty feet thiok\nand 30 feet high. Then another inner moat and then the castle\nreached through a single entaance over a draw indige.\nThe whole\noastle is remarkable well preserved, considering that it is over\n850 years old.\nPart of it is four stories high with capacity\nfor a garrison of 4000 men.\nThe pots in which they stored the\noil to throw flaning hot an the attackers are still in taot.\nDuring the 162 yeaza this seemingly imprognable fortress obanged\nhands a number of times ending up with the Hospitallers. It\nwas attaciced a number of times. Besieged by Saladdin in 1188\nbut he thought better of the idea and went sournd it to capture\nall the other strong points. and more or less destroy the Krak\nby laolating it. Pinally, however, some 83 Jeurs later 1t fell\nto a Noslen king, the guide book doenn't say how but I think\nthe commander who lost it hhould have been court martialled.\nThe history\nsays that the conquerozs were most lenient and with\nno further knowledge thain that I suspet that the Crusaders\nvere fed up and made a deal.\nThe Crusaders were not without\ntheir influnce in this community. Today you nee lote of blonde\nand many rod beado anons the Syrians, Lebanese and Arabe lo bad\nThurs.\nDeo.3.\nToday ve sort of jelled on future plans.\nhoped to 60 to Taharan, Iran and from there to Afghanastan but\nIts winter there and then too Teharan is 8000º and that altitude\nmight be a bit tough for me.\nSo rather reluotantly we have a\ndecided to leave here Deo. 7 for Bong Kong, stry there (address\n%:PAA Hong Kang) for about a week and then go to Manila for\nanother weeks.\nThen to Honolulu to arrive around the 20th of Jeo,\nstaying until about 28th then to Tahit until alout the 4th of Jan.\nwhen we'd fly to los Angeles for a few daya before flying to I.T.\nHMB",
