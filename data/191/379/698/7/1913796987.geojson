Dec. 5th, she talked me into going around.\nYou'd know that\nyou were not in Tiffany's.\nthat evening we had dinner with the\nBoyntons and the Bojonells, he is PAA #1 in Athens and was over here\non a brief business\ntrip.\nWe were glad to see\nthem again.\nBoynton\nhad just come bauk fron Cyprus.\nHe said externally at least, Cyprus\nnever had it so good.\nEvery hotel and cafe full every night with\nfree-spending\nUnited Nations people, Army officers and newspaper\nreporters fron all over the world.\nSun. Dec. 6th.\nI have stayed in bed all day trying unsuccessfully\nto shake a cold.\nTomorrow we leave for Hong Kong.\nI feel a little\nsad at not going to 8,000 foot level Teheran and\nsome what lower\nbut colder Afghanastan as we had more or less planned.\nGuess I am\nnot tough like my old friend Phil Ball.\nNo doubt most of you have\nheard this story but a good story is always worth repeating ( if you\ndon't do it too often).\nBack in 1927 Mr. Ball bought a Ryan airplane\nHe asked me to recommend a pilot and I did.\nThis particular man,\nFrank kgan Dunn, was about as homely and as tough as theyp come\nbut\na good safe pilot.\nWhen I sent Frank up to Mr. Ball's office for an\ninterview I said\n\"Frank, make it perfectly clear right from the\nstart that Mr. Ball is boss on the ground but that you are boss in the\nsky as well as deciding whether or not you should venture\ntherein\".\nFrank went on upstairs and about 20 minutes later cane back by my\ndesk in the old State National Bank.\nHe\nsaid \" Gee, I've net some\ntough guys but\nwe nade a deal, we'll\nget along all right\".\nAnother\nfive minutes\nand Mr. Ball cane\ndown \"Say Bix, where in h-- did\nyou find that\nporch climber?\"\nThey were together until Mr. Ball's\ndeath\n(in bed)\nsome 15 years later.\nWhen the Ryan was ready for\ndelivery\nthey went out to San Diego together..\nFrank was checked\nout on\nthe plane and they took off for El Paso.\nMr. Ball said\n\"Frank,\nclimb up to 12,000 feet\".\nFrank demurred because it was a\nslow\nclimb with a full load but he went on up to 12,000 feet and\nran \"down hill\" into El Paso.\nAs they were having dinner together\nthat night Frank said \"Mr.\nBall why did you want me to go to 12,000\nfeet?\"\nMr. Ball said \"Well Frank,\nI didn't want to worryy\nyou\nbut\nI don't mind telling you now.\nMy doctor told me hath\nthat if I\nwent\nup\nto 10,000 feet I'd drop dead.\nI knew that he didn't know\nwhat he was\ntalking about so I\nspotted him 2000 feet and as you\nknow I'm still around\".\nWell I just do not have as much nerve as\nold man Ball.\nWhen perhaps you can't get enough air to keep the\nold\npump going its better to play safe.\nI had another reason for\ngoing to Teheran.\nYears ago in New York, I got a call from a\nWhite House\ncontact asking me to meet a Mr. Pahlevi at theairport,\nshow him around, give him a good\ntime, \"quite important\" Wabhington\nsaid.\nSo I met Mr. Pahlevi who was a most friendly younguan,\nwent through the hangars, he tried the link trainer,\nand did.\nquite\nwell, we had the usual\nbuffet lunch where what you don't spill is\nyour\nown with a group of executives and pibots and the young man\nwhose Oxford English was better the",
