Dec. 7.\nThe\nEn route Karachi.\nWedre rather sad\nto be leaving Beirut.\nIntercontinental (Pan Am) Hotel is most comfortable, the service\nperfect and\nthe staff most friendly and happy.\nOur room on the 8th floor\nhad a room wide balcony with a splendid view of the whole city, the busy\nharbor and\nthe snow covered mountains to the east.\nEvery morning we get\nthe N.Y. Times or Herald Tribune Paris air mail edition of\nthe day before\nwith complete market quotations even seldom traded shares,\nthe American\nexchange\nand on Mondays even the unlisted dogs.\nIt would\nbe awfully easy\nto spend a winter in Beirut.\nWe arrived Karachi after asmooth four hour\nflight, stayed at the pirport for a half hour and were off for a 2} hour\nflight to Dum Dum airport, Calcutta.\nThat brought back the war days when\nBondy was doing such a magnificent gey job of directing CNAC operations over\nthe hump.\nAs I write this we have just landed in brilliant sun shine at\nRangoon.\nIts now 6:15 a.. Beirut time but 10:45 a.m. local time and when\nwe get to Hong Kong we'll have to move our watches back six hours.\nWe\n\"Time\"\ntrouble on all our trips.\nBangkok.\nField was covered with American transports, pursuit ships and\nbombers withthe bomb racks loaded.\nThey are here of course to\nback up\nour forces in Viet Nam.\nIncidentally our course from Bangkok to Hong Kong\ngoes right over where most of the fighting is going on.\nI hope the Commies\nhave not decided\nto make an \"incident\" out of this flight.\nLater...\nThey had not\nI'm sure I should have told my younger readers that lex Barker was very\nmuch in evidence around our hotel.\nFor the benefit of you oldsters he is\na sort of Tarzan character.\nAlso had Mickey Rooney, David Niven and some\nothers around mostly very dizzie blondes who have yet to make a name.\nWe arrived Hong Kong late in the afternoon in perfect visibility\nand\nwere both amazed at what has happened to\nthe Crown Colony,\nsince we last\nsaw it.\nI can't even begin to describe it.\nI suppose that no where else\nin the\nwhole world is there such a concentratint of people. One huge\napartment complex after another, something like those big housing develop=\nments in New York.\nYou know Hong Kong Colony is really made up of the Island\nof Victoria and a small peninsula on the mainland called Kowloon.\nThe\nlatter plus the island were deeded outright to the British by the Chinese.\nThen there is the\n\"leased territory\" about 10 miles square back of Kowloon\nwhich is leased to the British until 1997.\nMost of the new buildings\nhave been put up on the \"owned\" areas.\nWhen we lived in Hong Kohg the\npopulation was around one million with probably 75% of that on Victoria\nIsland.\nNow the population is just under four million with 70% on\nmainland and 30% on the island.\nThe government of Hong Kong has built\nmany huge apartments for the refugees who used to squat wherever they could.\nThese\n\"apartments\"\nare walk up mostly six stories high, some ten, with rooms\nmuch like a honeycomb.\nToilet and bath facilities are at the ends of the floors",
