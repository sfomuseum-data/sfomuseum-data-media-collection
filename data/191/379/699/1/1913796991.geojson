    "media:imagetext": "- 3-\nBill Cowden,\nPAA#1 and George Sellett met us at the airport and escorted us\nto the Intercontinental Mandarin, a 600 room 20 story hotel on Victoria\nisland about two blacks from the\nPost Office just behind the ferry landing.\nOur room looks out on the harbor with its constantly changing seene of\nferry boats, there are 8 crossing as I write this line, hundreds of\njunks\nfreighters, from all\nover the world with a few war ships and a passenger\nliner or\ntwo.\nMost of the treighters never touch shore, they are unloaded\nand loaded by a swarm of small craft coming along side and leaving all day\nand all night.\nWed. Dec. 9th.\ntended to tickets changing money etc. in the morning.\nGeorge Sellett came\nby for us about one o'clock and we drove to his house for\nlunch.\nWe crossed to the mainland\nby auto ferry and then out Nathan road\nby the old Peninsula Hotel and between apartment buildings, mostly new, to\nthe mountains that nark the beginning of the \"leased territory\".\nWe climbed\nup and up along a perfect road to the Carleton Hotel and just beyond that is\nGeorge's new \"estate\".\nWe drove through a gate to find ourselves in a small\ngarden full of those wonderful chrysanthemuns such as only Chinese gardeners\ncan groW.\nThe ground floor of the stone house is taken up with a screen\nwhich partly hides a rumpus room which the former owner had for the\nchildren.\nA winding stairway leads to an upper floor with bedrooms, 3, each\nwith bath to the right and to the left a larger living room with roan high\nsliging glass doors which open on a wide terrace which overlooks the whole\nof Hong Kong•\nFron the terrace the land falls away steeply to another\nterrace and\nthen another 20 feet down to a second with\na small swimming\npool\nand then yet another terrace which is his\ntruck garden.\nIt is a real\ngem.\nThe gouse is full of beautiful Chinese furniture.\nGeorge has a chauffeur\ncook, gardener, coolie and wash anah, quite an establishment and not the\nleast\nof the attractions.\nWe did\nnot\nget hone\nuntil late so had an early\nsnack (after George's enormous steak lunch) and to bed early. My cold is\nbetter.\nThurs.\nDec. 10t%h\nShopping•\nOne interesting government development in\nKowloon was the\nreclaiming of a large tract of\ntidal\nshallowa where a complex\nof apartments surrounds a harbor and provides a perfect shelter for junks\nand small boats during typhoons or rough\nweather.\nWe have fairly definite plans (for us) now.\nWe leave here at 1 p.I. on\nDec. 16 for Manila and leave there on the 20th for Honolulu arriving the\nsame day (thanks to gaining a day\ncrossing the International Date\nLine).\nYou will no doubt wonder about the Chinese Communists,\nand so do we.\nOutwardly they and China might as well be five thousand miles away.\nThe\nbee hive which is Hong Kong does on as though everyone expected to be here\nforever.\nThe government has just finished a 1,000 bed hospital, a\nmountain is being truncated\nthousands\nof men work around the clock on new buildings, in factories and on docks.\nThe first\ntime I was here after the\nCommunist\ntake-over in China the\nCommunist flag was everywhere.\nThe next time about five years later I saw\na few and this time none.\nReal Estate prices in the heart of Kowloon\nor\nVictoria (HongKong) are higher\nthan New York, sonething like 500 U.S. dollars\nper square foot.\nFriday Dec.\nWe had a trip by car all around\nthis island with coffee\nat the Repulse Bay Hotel where we lived for a while.\nThen we had lunch\nat the Pei ing restaurant with C.H. (Fatty)Moo.\nOthers\nthere were Nr. and\nost 1 on soneR at Canton:\nGeorge Sellett and my old friend Nixon, former\nWe had all of\nour old favorites, Pekin\nduck, sharks fin soup, mandarin fish, chicken and walnuts, bahboo shoots,",
