Dec. 12th\nGeorge Sellett's chauffeur took us for a drive\naround Kowloon\nand\nthe whole of the so called \"New Territory\"\nwhich is the leased area.\nIt\nwas like the old days in China, after we got out of\nthe \"Concrete Jungle\".\nHigh mountains franing fertile valleys in which every foot of land is used.\nHakka women with their unique hats of wide\nflat straw fringed with black\ncloth which hangs down all the way around five of six inches, plowing the\nfields with water buffalo.\nThey are descended fron the aboriginal people\nwho were here when the Chins came down fron the north.\nMany of you have\nread Michener's Hawaii and may remember that the heroine, Mrs. Kee, was a\n\"big foot Hakka\".\nHe drove out to a place where there was a road block and\na narrow strip of \"no man's land\" which separated the leased territory from\nCommunist China.\nA Hong Kong police tower\non high ground keeps constant watch\nthat no\nChinese\nfrom Red China get into the leased territory.\nHowever,\nfugitives continue to dross the border to add to Hong Kong's problem of\nwhere to put them and how to feed them.\nWe loved every minute of our trip\nwhich few drivers know how to make so we are again indebted to George Setlett.\nIt is all\nso fantastic, especially after a ride such as we had, this\nfabulous billion dollar colony which exists only at the pleasure of the\nChinese Reds.\nThey could take it in a matter of days, despite the growls\nof the British lion, just cut off the water supply and food, most of which\ncomes from Red China, and the colony would be on its knees.\nSunday Dec. 13th\nWe spent the morning shopping, most of\nthe shops stay\nand all building activity goes on just like any other day in the week.\nWill\nwind this up now and perhaps write once more before we get hime. We hope\nthis reaches you by Christmas.\nIt carries our best wishes for a very\nMerry Christmas and\nHappy New Year for each and every one of you.\nHarold",
