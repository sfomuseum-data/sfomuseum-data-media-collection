So we went by\nauto and thoroughly\nenjoyed the three hour drive along the sea most of the\nway, (the road was built be U.S. Marines for deployment of troops to repel\na threatened Japanese Invasion) through little villages and fields of sugar\nsugar, makes up about 50% of P1j1 earning with gold\nmining 20% and copra another 20%.\nOf course the Indian problem is always\npresent everywhere,\nespecially in the sugar cane fields and around the\nlarge mill at lautoka. It was to this port that we drove from Korolevu\nto spend Sunday night and get ready for our four day cruise starting the\nZollowing morning.\nMostly our preparations were taken up with getting rid\nof everything except the few itens we would need on board because we had a\nletter from the Captain stating that space was difficult to find.

The Yasava group was really discovered and\nquite well charted by Capt. Bligh when he and 18 others were cast adrift\nby the Bounty Mutineers. Bligh did not land his long boat and was chased\ntwice by large war canoes full of Cannibals looking for a little white meat.\nOur cruise was through largely uncharted seas with many small passageways\nthrough the Coral reefs. Our ship, the \"Blue Lagoon\",\nis 50 feet long with\ntwo diesel engines which drive it along about 10 to 15 miles an hour.
