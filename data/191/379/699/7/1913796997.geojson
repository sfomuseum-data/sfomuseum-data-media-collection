Then a spear dance by\nthe warriors folloud by singing which reminded me so much of the Hawailan\nsinging of 50 years ago. He spent the rest of the afternoon on the\nbeautiful beach in front of the Captaine \"bure\". Debby and I found song\nfairly good shells.\nThe beach and harbor are surrounded by mountains\nheavily wooded above a fringe of coconut palms which skirt the shore. The\nmeat of the coconut, or \"Copra\",\n', is the only cash crop of the YasaMas. The\ncoconuts are gathered by the natives and carried by boat to a central drying\nand shipping point.\nTuesday, Dec. 3. We sailed early, past a very high mountain with\nSee sit that area virgin tap do for eard hate or four undred\nhundred years ago some invaders over-powered and killed all the warriors on\nthe island.\nThe wives and daughters having taken refuge on the mountaln\ntop leaped off the cliff. The natives have promised to bury Capt. Withers\non that mountain top. We cruised among the islands with a rod out most of\nthe time. We took turns fishing and I was lucky enough to catch a 35 1b.\nyellow fin tuna, quite a battle. We stopped at a number of villages and\nbeaches including the \"Blue Lagoon\" a beautiful coral reef,- surrounded\nlagoon with thousands of small highly colored fish swiming in and out of\nthe multi-colored coral in the crystal clear water.\nOur final stop on our second day out was at Nacula island where\nanchored at 6 p.m. At this place as the others we went ashore in a\nsnall dinghy usually in two bout loads.\nAfter dinner on board the Captain\nannounced that the people of the island about thirty in all (excluding\nchildren) had invited us to come ashore for Yangona and a \"Mele\" or\ncelebration.\nThey had built a big fire on the beach and in the light of\nthat fire they passed the Tangona - tastes like soapy water - when the\nwarrior in full war paint holds the coconut bowl straight out in front of\nhim you are supposed to clap your hands once, then hold out your bowl into\nwhich he poures the Yangona.\nYou then must drink it all without stopping.\nWhen your cup is dry you toss it on the ground and the natives chant in\nFijian \"It 18 dry\".\nYou then clap your hands three times and the ceremony,\nso far as you are\nconcerned, is over. When we and our guests had all been\nserved, sitting on the ground, the natives started singing to the accomplament\nof two or three ukes and one guitar. The singing is truly remarkable. In\nthe first place their language, as Hawalian, is composed of all vowels and\nthere is no harsh sound, then their voices and the music are both good and\nfinally they sing\nthe parts to perfection. Of course they just love any\nto have a celebration.\nIn the early days the Missionarys taught\nthem that dancing was very wicked. Of course hymn singing was very good.\nThe natives loved\nthe hymns, that was ok - but they still wanted to dance\nso the nissionarys compromised and let then dance the \"Taralals\" wherein\nyou stand side by side with your partner putting your arm around her and\nshe puts her arm around you.\nThen you start to shuffle to the misie and\nbreak away\nwhen it stops.\nThe moon came out casting long shadows of the\ntall coconut palms on the white beach with the water gently lapping the",
