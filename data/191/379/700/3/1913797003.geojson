Dec. 20 le sook off for Quem, Hake, Honolulu, a total 86 5,300\nmiles.\nIn Manila the PAA/l and his wife took uf to a series of parties\nevery night.\nAll their friende were very kand to include us and as\nmost of the affairs were large I guess a couple of more didnÂ°t maice\ntoo much difference. Ne saw lota of old faiends. The party we enjoyed\nthe woet was cocktails for just un and the Oppenheimera (PAA#1) given\nby General and Ars. Carlos Romlo at their beautiful home on the out\nskirts of Manila.\nHe has held many important posts such as Philipline\nAmbassador to the U.S. and more important President of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations.\nYou old China Hands will laugh when\nI tell you that for small chow we had among other things Quail eggs.\nPersonally I'd rather eat f'em a your or two later after they have\nbecone birds. Romulo, you will remember was with MacArthur on Corrigidor\nand wrote a best seller which I think was called \"I Saw the Pall of the\nPhilippines\" or sonething like that. In his study he has autographed\npictures of four or five Presidents and most of the crowned beads of\nthe world and a whole case full of decorations.\nHe was the speaker\nat the 250th aommencement of Washington University in Sto Louis and\nwas given a degree by Ethan Shepley. He is now President of the\nUniversity of the Philippines.\nHe and his wife are most charming\npeople. After we got to Honolulu one of the papers carried the piece\nwhich I enclose. In his five points Romulo expresses ky own convictions\nfar better than I am able to do. I think you wild agree that it is\nworth reading.\nThis morning wille Debby packed I took a ride on a Hydrofoil boat\nfrom in front of the Manila Hotel to our old sea plane base at Cavite.\nWe made the round trip in an hour at a speed of about 40 miles per\nhour.\nWith a full load of 70 passengers both ways.\nOne interesting\nthing about Manila is that none of the newspapers, there are several,\npublishes any daily weather information.\nWhy should they.\nThe weather\nis always the same 80-90 except if there is a typhoon hovering amund.\nThat is well publicized.\nTo my mind a sad development has been the\nacceptance of Tagabog as the official language.\nThis is simply a very\nstupid expression of nationalism.\nThey are turning their baoks on the\nwealth of English and Spanish literature to adopt a language only\nrecently reduced to writing with no back ground whatever.\nhe 10ft Manila at 2830 sunday afternoon, Deo. 20, and now as I write\nthis we bave just landed at Wake 3,000 to the east.\nIt is now 2 a.M.\nSunday morning Dec. 20th. and we are scheduled to arrive Honalulu 5,300\nmiles from Manila some four or five hours earlier than our take-off, due\nof course to crossing the Date line.\nLater, Tues. Deo. 22.\nThe hoiel situation at this time of year in\nHonolulu is really tough because a constantly increasing number of\nMainlanders come here for Christmas.\nPAA booked us in a brand new\nhotel on Waikiki, beach called the Kaimana. It is between Diamond\nHead and the wide blue Paoific,\nOur 6th floor room\nfrom which we view the whole of the Beach.\ndISSIISIPIOS",
