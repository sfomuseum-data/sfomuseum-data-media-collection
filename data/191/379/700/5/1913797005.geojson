We\nrented a zadio and\nhave enjoyed the Hawaiian singing. Just a few\nminutes ago the station we are listening to announoed that the 500,600\nvisitor of 1964\nwould land tonight.\nI remanber when BAA a PAA witneas\nin the original Pacifto Certificate hearing predicted that 60,000\npassengers a year\nwould travel by air and ship to Honolulu and the CAB\nattorney moved\nthat the entire testimony should be stricken from the\nzeoord because\nsuch visionary irresponsible witness should not be\nazedi ted.\nThe H.V.B. (Hewels Visitors Bareau) is now trying to raise\n$1,450,000\nfor 1965. They say that \"tourlem has akyzooketed fron a\nsix million dollar\nbusiness in 1946 to 225 million in 1964\".\nA sholl collector friend of Debby's invited us out so his house on\nthe\nother side of\nthe Pall to see his collection.\nle is a world authoris\nand has probably\nthe beat collection of volutes. It was a lovely ride\nhe has a beautiful\nhome right on the beach and Deb had a field day.\nDeo.\n24 th\nLast night the Mullakrys (PAA/1) invited us for dimer with\na Me. and Mrs.\nGeorge England. He is doing motion ploture having to do\nw1 th\nthe\n1110\nand voyages of Capt.

At any\nrate they do not play or sing \"White Christmas\".\nPerhaps they ame\nafraid some of the d-\n- Tankees will get nostalgio and go home.\nMost of you have beazd of \"custoners men\", they are the number one\nmisnoner in all the world.\nIn a brokerage office the \"customer's\nman's\" only funation da to \"take\" the customer in every conceivable\nway for the benefit of the house.\nToday Debby and I net a real honest\nto goodness\n\"Customer's man\".\nWe thought of going to alot of placed\nfor Christmas dimer bat finally concluded that wood rather atay home.\nThe\nrestaurant in this hotel was praotioally deserted. All the walters\nand waitresses had the day off.\nThe Japanese boy who waited on us was\nquite obviously a fugitive fron the dish washers chain gang, snatobed\noff the job to fill in as a waiter. He ordered avacados stuffed with\nchroken salad. - Our gaites aaid \"those avocados are not so good- I\nthink you'd better have tomatoes\" so we did.\nThen for desert balty\nordered a piece of chocolate cake but our waiter said \" I wouldn\"t eat\nthat if I were you, ite been in the ice box for a long time\". So at\nlast I've met a\nreal \"customer's man\". I gave him a vezy large tip\nand a \"Herry\nChristmas\" which I'm sure was as unusual for him as was the\noustoner-de\nman's servioe for us.\nAt any rate we had a grand Christnas,\nmost of it spent on the calm, sun-drenched beach at Walkiki.\nDeo. 26th\noax and drive\nTo dept dat olay got to thaning bout one mot on\n100, so we\nchanged that progran and decided to stay with Ban Am.\nInstead of taking American Airlines from Los Angeles to N.T. on Jan. 5\nwe are going to fly PAA from Los Angeles to Quatenala to Miani on the\n5th arriving Miami around 9 poll. where we'll piok up a Berta Dutve",
