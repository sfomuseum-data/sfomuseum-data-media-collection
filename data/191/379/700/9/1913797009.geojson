    "media:imagetext": "Honolulu, Dec. 27, 1964\nDear F and 2,\nHe have thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Honolulu. Our hotel is pretty\nfar out on Waikiki. Beach but the management runs a bus in town every\nhour on the hour for free and so you have a little quiet and seclusion\nbut you are in the middle of things if you wish.\nThere is a lovely\nbeach.\nEvezgone who works in the hotel seons to like his or her job\nand is intent on seeing that you like \"their\" hotel.\nAnother nice\nthing about Honolulu, especially after Beirut, all the auto drivers,\npublic and private, stop and let you cross the stroet at the frequent\nplaces mariced for that purpose.\nA blind man would'at last 24 hours in\nBeirut but he would die of old age in Honolulu.\nWe're off tomorrow for\nTehiti.\nhe pacised all our heavy clothes, sweatere etc. in four suit\ncases and will ship as\n\"unacconpanied luggage\" right through to Miami.\nThat pleases ne beasuse I liico to travel light.\nMonday, Deo. 28th\nHe took off at 2 p.m. for the 2700 mile flight to\nTahi ti\nand our pilot estimated five hours.\nNow we have crossed the\nEquator.\nJust tor fun I maried up a map and found that this in the\n14th place that I've ozossed.\nLater.\nhe arrived in exactly 5 hours and took a taxi to our hotel, the\nMoane Nui which is a long way out of town.\nWe're in a hut with a\nthatched roof which in quite confertable but we are very far away from\neverything with no car, bus service or taxis. PAA put us here because\nthe only other hotel was full.\nTuesday, Dec. 29th.\nThe other good hotel, The Rahiti, is owned byt the\nWeaver brothere of Honolulu.\nChris leaver, Debby's shell colleoting\nfriend said his brother was here and he'd give hin a \"jangle\".\nhe did because this noming the assistant manager phoned to say they\ncould take us in provided we could set there.\nThat last line calls for\nan explanation.\nWhen we arrived at the airport last night we weren met\nby a very harried air port manager for PAA and Traffio reprosentative.\nIt seems an island wide strike had been set up for today.\nlobody but\nnobody was going to work except hotel personnel.\nOur people had a phane\nto dispatch with no my of setting passengers to the field.\nIt seems\nthat this paradise is not entirely without troubles,\nthey have politicins.\nthe latter have just announded two uppopular things.\n#2, an income tax\nand 1/2, a 50, increase in the pay of all politicians.\nSo the protest\nstrike.\nFortunately an old PAA pilot friend of ours offered to drive un\nto the Tahiti so here we are. A most lovely place right on the water.\nNo have a room overlooking the ocean in a new addition.\nThere is a\nlarge open terrace facing the ocean with lota of tables and chairs betireen\nthe apacious bar and the dining room where the food is French at its\nbeat.\nI think we're going to like this spot.\norderly with no apparent communistic influence or tectios.\nis that the politicos have agreed not to put on any incone tax and the\nstrike will be over tomorzow.\nHed. Dec. 30ieth.\nStrike over at least for the present.\nIt seems the\nwhole question has been referred to Paris and the final decision will be\ndelayed.\nThero is no question in ny mind that \"Colonialian\" is on its\nway out here just as it is all over the world.\nToday we made a trip\naround the island by automobale on a good black topp highway.\nabout 65 miles.\nThe road runs along a fringe of varrying width from a\nquarter to half a mile withthe ocean on one side and very steep mountains",
