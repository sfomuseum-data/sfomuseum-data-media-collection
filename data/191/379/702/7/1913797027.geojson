    "media:imagetext": "Nov. 7th Wednesday\n1934\nDearest Debs:\nEddie Smith called me\nup late this afternoon and told me of hi\ntalk with you at Kiukiang on his way\nup to Hankow. He said that you\nwere already a day late. That\nmeans I guess that you did not\narrive in Hankow until today\nand there is no telling I guess\nwhether or not you will make up\nany schedule. Against that dis-\nadvantage about travel in China is the\nfact that if you want to travel on\nstrict schedule it would be better to\nride the Bronxville trains to Grand\nCentral.I imagine it is a bit discon-\ncerting and hope that such little in-\nconveniences will not mar your trip to\nsuch an extent as to take all the pleas\nure out of it. However I know such is\nnot the case.\nHad a busy day today and\nwe got a few things done at the directors\nmeeting with the main session however\npostponed until next Monday. I had dinner\nhere and let Gin Tsu go home. The kids\nwere fast asleep by the time I arrived\na little after eight P.M. The Jones family\nare here now and I had dinner with them.\nThey loved Peiping and Mrs. Chens.\nHave a lot of work to do and will\ntry to get along with it in this icebox\nwhile the fire is still struggling.",
