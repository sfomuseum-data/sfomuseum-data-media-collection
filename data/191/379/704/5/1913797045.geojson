He caught hold of the rope and pulled and beat on the box\nwith his hands and smiled and was having a swell time. - after spend\nding ten hours between decks in a situation that must have been at\nleast somewhat like the Black Hole of Calcutta. I thought to\nmyself\n\"Sonny you may live to be a coolie, or you may not live at all, but\njust now you are a man and I take my hat off to you.\" I decided I\nwould get to Kowan all right and there would be nothing to it.\nYes terday about two P.M., after giving notice, the Jap-\nanes e started outn to demolish Nantao because there are some Chin-\nese troops there who were eut off and will not surrender.\nI stood on\nto p of the Dollar Building and\nwatched airplanes drop fifty to ah\nhundred bombs and heard the artillery from near Jessfieldshelling it,\nfiring over the city. It was rather depressing. Nantao is surrounded\non the North, East and West by the Whangppoo and the French Concession\nin all they could,\nession. So Nantao\ntook it. But it isn't my idea of a war. Just coward-\nly murder. The shelling by the artillery kept up all night at long\nintervals, just to keep the civilians happy I suppose. However to\nforeigners Shanghei is entirely safe and as soon as this Nantao bu-\nsiness is over that will be the end of the fighting in the near vici-\nnity. When our boat passed around Woosung, we estimated there were one\nmostly transports, anchored in the river.\nI got a message two days ago from Bix in Nanking, saying he was\nleaving for Hankow and for me to meet him there and to go via Hong\nKo ng, but I decided I could make it this way Quicker, s o I am on\nmy way. The result of the present condition of the war will be that\nAmerican boats will soon be calling at Shanghai I think. The Chinese\nsay they are just starting, but I don't know. Will write you fully\nfrom Hankow.\nOn board the s.s.\nChangsha\nI think it is\nNov. 14th\nWe made it, but what a trip! That is we got from Nant\ntungch ow around to Kowan, got aboard another Bos steamer and are\nnow on our way to Nanking.\nThe next morning after the first part of\nthe enclosed letter was written it started drizzling and the weather\nwas awful. We went ashore about ten A.M. as the B\u0026S agent had told\nus no cars were permitted by the military to start out before noon.\nBy ten it was raining and no cars were permitted to go at all, but\nwe learned that a convo y of about eight cars had started about six\nthirty A.M.\nbefore the rain started. The damned fool English agent\nwas the dumbest most impossible\ncouldn't get started. The first nigh t we arrived and he came aboard\nhe told us we could get cars the next day at noon provided it didnt\nrain. When one of the passengers suggested we\nought to get started\nANNONISAOS",
