Morgan,\nPan American Airways Company,\nNew York.\nDear Stokeley:\nI have your memorandum attached to clipping from the New York\nTimes under Shanghai date line of November 23rd, the article appearing\nof Hallett Abend.\nIf you have not done so would\nsuggest that you\nread Abend's book \"Can China Survive\"\nworthwhile.\nIn that book in which Abend\nâ€¢ Billing-\nham,\nit was pointed out that the Communists and many war lords in outlying\nprovinces would\ncertainly revolt against the Central Government in the event\nof a war with Japan and numerous other\npredictions were made none of which\nhas been true\nand all of which were slightly cynical with respect to\nChinese in general.\nIn other words I\nis possibly over critical.\nOn my recent trip to Nanking I learned from the best authority\nthat in July Chiang Kai-shek called in all of the important\nagainst the Chinese in its earliest stages and\nasked them if they would be\nwilling to support the National Government in the\nconduct of such a war.\nThe unanimous verdict was in favor of war unless Japanese\nagression ceased.\nThe question was then asked by the Generalissimo of the Southern and other\nleaders whether or not they would continue to\nsupport the Central Government\nafter the loss of Shanghai.\nThere was no hesitancy whatever on the part of the\ngroup present in accepting this possibility and assuring complete support.\nThe question was then asked whether they would continue\nto support the Central\nGovernment following the loss of Nanking and again the support was unanimous.\nIf we can accept this statement as reasonably reliable it\nseems to me that the\nwar to date has gone pretty much as\nthe Chinese anticipated and it seems\nme at least that if the Chinese morale does not collapse that their position\nis gotting stronger all the time while the Japanese position is becoming more\nIn other words I felt in the beginning and have seen no reason\nsince to\nchange my opinion, that the Japanese strategy would be to take North.\nblocade all Chinese ports, seize Shanghai and\nthen stand thus compelling\nthe Chinese to carry the war against well defended Japanese\npositions at points\nchosen by the Japanese as the most favorable to defend.\nThis would have\ncreated a situation where the cost to the Japanese would have been reduced to\na minimum and the Chinese would have been compelled to attack, a form of war-\nfare with which they are not familiar.\nAs against this\nstrategy the Japanese\nto me have made a great mistake in following the Chinese inland.\nis now necessary for the Japanese to maintain a precarious service of supply\nover a very\nwide area and to maintain a front line which in the Nanking area\nalone will be more than 500 miles in length. If the present rumors are true\nthat the Japs expect to attempt to take Canton it seems to me that this will\nbring about a unification such as China has never known ard will in turn fur-\nther weaken the Japanese position.\nCommentint now upon Abend's statement to the effect that Chinese\npossibly lost view of the fact that the Chinese soldier is accustomed to hard",
