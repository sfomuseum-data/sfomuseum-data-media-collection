    "media:imagetext": "PERSONAL\nDecember 30, 1937\nMr. Harold M. Bixby\nPan American Airways Co.\nManila, Philippine Islands\nDear Harold:\nI was much interested in your personal letter of December 17\ncommenting upon recent developments in the war in China.\nYou and I are\nseeing\nthis great drama from such widely divergent angles and interpret-\ning it from such different sources of infor atior that it is very inter-\nesting to exchange views, not with the idea that either of us can really\nclaim to know anything but simply to compare notes, which must undoubtedly\ngive both of us some advantage in shaping our necessarily varying opin-\nionsâ€¢\nI should like to comment seriatum ou some of your points as\nfollows:\n1.\nThe fact that there was unanimity among the Chinese\npolitical and military leaders with regard to the question of coming to\ngrips with Japan does not, I fear, mean that such unanimity can neces-\nsarily continue unbroken during any long protracted struggle.\nChinese\nhistory is not encouraging in this regard and you know yourself how un-\nreliable sone of these people are in the face of discouragement and op-\nportunities to pull out to their own advantage.\nhave no means of knowing, how much of any\ntreak there not ken in the\npolitical and military united front of China, but I think you are assum-\ning a good deal when you assume that it is still unbroken.\nIt may not\ncrumble as fast as some people expect but I do think it will have a ten-\ndency that way.\n2.\nYou say\nthe war to date has gone pretty\nmuch as\nChinese anticipated.\nthe\nThat is undoubtedly true so far as the map of mili-\ntary operations shows the course of hostilities, but I doubt if the Chin-\nese ever anticipated the terrific debacle that they suffered at Nanking\nand the very heavy loss of life and supplies (munitions, etc.) which they\nhave experienced.\nthat similar conditions would have On Occidentals.\nYou are probably right\nin saying that they will take much more without cracking, because they\nare used to adverse conditions.\nNevertheless, there must be a limit to\nwhat even the Chinese coolie can endure, and it would seem that during the\nmonth of Decenber they just about reached the breaking point.",
