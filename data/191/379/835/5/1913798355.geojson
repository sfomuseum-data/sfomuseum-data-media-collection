In the\nsecond place\nI am sunk over the loss of the\nold Hongkong Clipper with Musick and Sellers.\nWe have had only brief\nand conflicting reports but it does appear as the time wears on that the\ncrew are\nall dead and the ship a total\nher\nPoor gene Sellers! I sent\na telegram expressing sympathy and am writing her by this same mail.\nIsn't it terrible to think of\nprice\nthose men all lost - it seems such a terrible\nto pay.\nBond came down today from Hankow and he is here now with\nme .\nThe\ncerned.\nsituation at Hankow is very much improved so far as CNAC is con-\nThe M.D.\nis definitely through and P.Y. Wong has been selected as\nnis successor•\nRevenue is much better and the future looks as bright as\nany future can look just now in China.\nI am writing this letter on my \"Christmas present\"\nincidentally I like very much.\nwhich\nbrief case. I'm crazy about it.\nIt weighs only 8f Ibs\"and fits into my\nGot a wire from Van Zandt that Alameda confirmed\nfor the gilrs on Jan. 29th and assume that you are\nsending their trunks\nalong to Honolulu ahead of time.\nSorry that I could not attend to the\ndetails in\nconnection therewith on account of my extended stay in Hong-\nkong.\nIsn't it maddening this long delay.\nEach time I have been ready\nto leave here by boat there has been a Clipper just about ready,\neven as\nnow,\nto come on over here.\nI assumed that you have kept track through the\nnewspaper of the schedules and have therefore not telegraphed my plans.\nAl so\n- have not written for each sailing it seemed, including this one,,\nthat I would arrive before\nthe boat.\nI did write to you once when I\nthought you would\ncertainly get my letter before I would make a personal\nappearance.\nAnd I have had no word of any kind from you.\nI am just\nwondering if that dumb bell Van Zandt is responsible for not forwarding\nyour letters by ordinary means instead of waiting for the Clipper.\nI now expect to leave here on Sunday and arrive that day at\nthe Manila Hotel from where I will immediately call you on the phone.\ndo hope\nthat you and the kids are all well.\nHate to think of the girls\ngoing home\nso soon after my arrival as I will hardly have a chance to\nsee them before they will be leaving.\nMy mail from NY of course gas been\ndelayed and I do not know what reaction Mr. Trippe had to my suggestion\nthat I return but am fairly sure that we can get away whenever we want\nto •\nThe Mania market has been improving Eight along and we\nwill have plenty of money for the girls or any other expense (within\nreason)\nthan\nwhich may come along.\nMy salary check for January will be more\n2000 Pesos and we can draw a like amount from Swan Culbertson and\nFritz if needed.\nAlso of course we can always draw on the company for\na reasonable amount as advance of travel\nexpenses.\nSo dont worry about\nfinances!\nHave been to a few movies, read a great deal and worked on\nmy book a little.\nOthereise\n- no hits\nno. runs\nnor errors!\nAll my love\nyour own\nBik",
