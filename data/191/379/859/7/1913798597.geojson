I.\nespecially Sid laestre, Lew Pumsey and Vill Pettus.\nPardon this long letter\nand please keep it like others you have seen more or less confidential as I\ncertainly do not wish to be placed in the position of \"experting\" a situation\nconcerning which men of more ability and better sources of information are re-\nluctant to write.\nDear 1. 0.\nI am sending this in duplicate in case you may wish to forward the\noriginal to Clarence Francis whose address is c/o Gen*1.
