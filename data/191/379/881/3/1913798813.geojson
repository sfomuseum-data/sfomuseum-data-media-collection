I.\nDear Mr. Bixby:\nI have been trying for some time to get up\nenough courage to\nwite you a letter containing\nsomething more, or less, than a\nmere recital of the events of the day as they take place.\nIt is now just six months.\nI landed in China on my return from the\nthe States and all my /ideas\non the situation out here are as\nshifting now as\nwere then, probably more so. I have\ntried. constantly to form/some\nconclumion, even in the most\nand indefinite terms, as to what the outcome\nof the present\nconditions in China would be, and how they would effect CNAC and\nwhat would be\nway to meet the situation, but so far 1\nhavent been able to reach any conclusion with sufficient clearness\nto form a foundation for any particularly definite course of action.\nAbout all I am really going on is hope, a term I use with full\nconsideration. Howeder in any circumstances you must haver some\nplan of action however unsatisfactory. Ours is insecurely based\non the guess and bope method. We are simply living and working\nto day. We are of course making every effort to be able\ncontinue\nthis day to day existence as long in the future as\npossible, but that\nis as far as I have got up to now.\nThere have been many things in this war which have been a\ndisappointment\nto me and of\ncourse there have been some agreeable\nsurprises.\nThe Chinese people as a whole, according to my ideas,\nare not\nin this war and never have been.\nMaybe it would be fairer\nto say that the Chinese are very much in this war but their\nresistance. has\nbeen mostly passive resistance. But it is very\nto win a war with passive resistance, particularly against\nthe Japanese. You may acquire many moral victories and\nyou may win\nwhat comes after the war, although I question that also with the\nJapanese. Also it/As difficult to win a xur modern war with coolies\nmostly\ngrabbed up off the street. The upper and middle\nclass Chinese\nyet realized that this is really their war and they have\nto furnish the backbone\nas well as the brains\nof the\nfighting 1f\nthey have any hope of winning, It is almost inconceivable for\nnation to have beeniin such a war as this for seven months, with\nits territory invaded and its poople to have\nsuffered\nsuch\nhorrors\nand barbarous treatment as the Chinese have and yet\nnot find\npractically every ablebodied man between twenty and forty trying\nto get into the army. But / do not know one\nChinese who has gone\ninto the fighting forces since this war started or who has a son\nwho has done so. I realize there must be many\nof\nthe so called\nbetter classes who are in the army but they are comparatively few.",
