    "media:imagetext": "CNAC I presume has approximately four hundred employees. The\nAviation Commission got a few mechanics from us but we havent had\none man join a fighting force.\nWe hear a lot about\nguerilla warfare, in the papers. Also we hear\na lot about skirmishes\nand big battles pending along the Lunghai\nRailway. While in Hankow last week I talked to one of the best known\ncorrespondents who had just returned from that area. He left he\nsaid because there was nothing going on. He thought\nthe Japanese\ncould march any where they want and take any place they want, he\ncould not understand why they were so inactive. The night before\nI left Hankow I\ninvited Donald and Capt. McHugh to dinner. I do\nnot wish to quote either of these gentlemen, they\ntold me\nvery interesting and amising stories,\nsome\nbut nothing to indicate I\nwas\nVEry\nfar\nwrong in my\nviews. Donald did seem to think the\nIndustrial\nsituation in Japan was worse than\ngenerally known\nand might become\neffective soon, also that Japan was having much\ndifficulty getting raw material. No doubt, so is China.\nIt\nseems\nto me however that Japan could continue this war, as it is now\nbeing fought, for several\nyears and at the end have more raw\nmaterial, supplies than China had in the beginning. Any financial\ncrash or political upheavel in Japan in my opinion will not come\nIf at all, until after the war. Unless of course something aw\nunexpected happens.\nI do not wish to appear either pessimistic or optomistic. CNAC\nis doing as well\nas I ever expected, better in fact, we are\nstaying in business and paying expenses. It would befoolish for\nme to say I have no idea of the outcome, that is too obvious.\nI have reached only one firm conviction, which e may be all\nwrong,\nand that is, that no matter how this war ends, either in a\ncomplete victory for Japan or an over-whelming victory for China\nor any point between these two extremes, PAA's only hope for\nsalvaging something out of the China investment depends entirely\non what there is left to salvage when the war is over. If we can\nrender a service to China during this crisis, and I think we\ncertainly\nare, this may in turn be helpful to PAA after the war\nis over, if China comes out of it even partially in tact. If Japan\nwins the war completely and enforces harsh terms then PAA's only\nchances to recover anything is for CNAC to be going concern,\nno matter uncertain the going may be. Our head may be bloody\nbut\nif it is unbowed they cant count us out. At least I hope they cant.\nThat added up outlines all I know and plan in China. It is clear I\ndo not know much and my plans are very modest. It is a weak effort\nat best but it seems to me it has to be made. I dont like the job\nto talk myself into a job Mr. Trippe has me thrown out of his\n0 520/156Plos",
