August 24, C.N.A.C. •Douglas Plene No. 32, piloted by myself\ndeparted fron Kal Tak Airport, Hong Kong, enroute Huchow, Liuchow, Chungking.\nand Chengtu,\nA few minutes after leaving the boundary of the Colony, at an altitude\nof approximately six thousand feet ond still climbing, I sighted eight planes\ndirectly ahead of me which I took to be Japanese, having seen similar flights\nof Japanese planes in this vicinity. I turned around and eome back to the\nedge of the Colony, to give the planes time to pass, then proceeded on my\ncourse of 297 Degrees, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.\nAs I reached the west end of the bay between Hong Kong territory and\nthe mainland, at about 8130 a.m., I looked back and sighted five pursuit planes\ndiving in ny direction.\nThey were at that time sbout 3,000 or 4,000 feat above\nme and perhaps a half mile to the rear. I immediately looked for some clouds\ninto which I could take cover, and noticed a smell patch at an altitude of about\n3,000 feet just a short distance ahead and slightly to my left.\nI immediately\nput the plane in a steep dive and resched these clouds only to find they were\ncovering the tops of some suell mountains which projected into them.\nI went into the edge of these clouds and was in there for a few seconds\nand emerged on the other side. Directly ahead of me all was clear so I started\nto run to re-enter the clouds when I heard machine-gun bullets astriking the\nplane.\nI was conscious of what seemed to be two bullete striking inside the\ncontrol room.\nI immediately started descending in a tight spiral. During\nthis spiral I could see the shadow of my plane, also the shadow of another\nplane directly st my rear.\n1801, ISI.POS",
