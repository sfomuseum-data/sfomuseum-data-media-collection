I considered it extremely hazardous to attempt a\nlanding on land, due to these dykes, so headed for a river a short distance\nto y right.\nI shut off the engines, cut the motor witches, and disconnected the\nbattery, and glided into a landing on the water.\nDuring this time the plane\nwas being struck by machine-gun bullets.\nThe plane was lended safely near the right-hund side of the river.\nBy\nthe time the water cleared from the windshield, however, the eurrent had caught\nthe plane and swept it into the niddle of the current.\nI first ascertained that everyone in the plane wes unhurt.\nI instruct-\ned that the outaide cabin door not be opened, but the stemurd had already opened\n1t as the water level was approximtoly two feet below the lower part of the\ndoor. I instructed the radio oporator to notify all concerned that everyone\nwas safe.\nAs soon as the plane stopped, the pursuit planes started machine-gunning\nus. I raised the emergency hatch cover in the front of the control room and\nlooked up in the direction from which we were being attached. At this time\nI could see the attacking planes clearly and positively identified them as\nThey were pontoon bi-planes. Although I eould see the markings\nclenrly, I did not take time to notice whether they were mingle-place or\ntwo-place.\nThe only sampans on the river were being rowed away by their occupents\nrapidly. I then noticed a samplan tied up to shore directly oppoaite our\nposition. I turned to the radio op rator and co-pilot and told then to\ninstruct the passengers who could swim to jump, and that I was going to attempt\nto reach shore and secure the sempen.\nWith this I Jumped into the water\nnd started swimming toward shore.",
