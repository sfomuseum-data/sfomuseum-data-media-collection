As I was\nprogressing toward shore several Japanese planes dived on me and machine-gunned\nше.\nAt first I submerged nyself when they started shooting, but later beesme\nso exhausted I could not do this. Many bullets caneextremely close so close\nin fact that it left no doubt as to whether they were aiming at me or the\nship. After what seened an endless time, I resched the shore in a state of\ncomplete exhaustion. I was umble to raise myself out of the water for\nsome time.\nEither at the time I resched shore or at the time I finally pulled myself\ncompletely out of the water, I saw the Douglas a considerable distance down\nstream, half submerged, floating in a nose-down position. I believe it was\nat this time I looked at my watch and ascertained the time to be 8:50 a.m.\nIt was probably over an hour before I could stand.\nI was violently 11l\nat my stomach.\nAs soon as I gathered sufficient strength, I started walking along the\nbank of the river in the direction the plane hed disappeared.\nAfter walking\napproximately a half mile, I came upon a soldier and was led to where another\ngroup of soldiers were located. Both the soldiers and myself were trying to\nget information, but as they spoke no English I spoke no Chinese, were unsuccess-\nful.\nEven at this time the Japanese planes were still in the vicinity. Just\nwhen they stopped machine-gunning the plane and myself, I an not sure.\nAfter mmerous unsuecessful attempts on the part of the soldiers and\nmyself to comminicate, I was put into a saall fishing boat, accompenied by one\nsoldier, and proceeded with the current into the interior. I understand this\nwas a tidal current that was flowing.\nWe rode for more than an hour and finally landed at a smell village.\n4/201,151,0/05",
