I have noticed\nthey were aleys in a climb and at an altitude of between 6,000 and 7,000 feet,\nwhich would be about normal, considering the distance fron their base.\nOn this\nparticular trip, however, when I first noticed them, they were around 11,000 or\n12,000 feet, and from their speed it was evident that they had dived from con-\nsiderable distance even then,\nAlso I was attacked fron such a direction aB\nto make it impossible to attent turning around and resching Hong Kong Colony.\nThen, in my opinion, the most conclusive evidence that shooting down my ship was\ntheir definite objective was the fact that after I had been forced to land, end\nthe plane had been sunk, they continued to stey in that vicinity, instead of con-\ntinuing as they would have done, had they started out on any other objective.\nI understond Dr. Sun Fo had intended to take my plane that morning, and 1t 18\nvery probable that the Japanese Ver Office thought they were eliminating him woen\nthey shot down my plane.\n(Signed) Hugh S.
