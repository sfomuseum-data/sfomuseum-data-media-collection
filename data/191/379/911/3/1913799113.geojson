Y•\nDear Bix:\nI have not written you for some time, partly because I have\nfelt that PAA rather frowned on personal letters, and also because\nthere has been little to say which has not been fully covered in my\nletters to Mr. Morgan.\nYour letter from Alaska was very much enjoyea\nIt certainty\nmust be\nincoristing country up there ana from all I\nhave read about it it should nave considerable sound development.\nIts contrast to China must have been refreshing•\nam\nsure you have been very much concerned over the latest\nevents out here in which the Japanese seemed to have declared open\nseason on all commercial planes.\nIt surely has caused me plenty of\nhead aches and\nstill\nis.\nYou no doubt will have heard by the time this reaches you that\nKitsi is returning to the States on the Clipper on the 29th. These\nrecent developments certainly have upset our plans.\nWe had\nplanned\nfor her to go home the middle of this month and\nget the baby and bring\nhim back at once, being back here by Christmas or much sooner. We\nhad taken an apartment on the Peak for six months from the middle\nof November and I almost stafted believing in Santa Claus again.\nWith conditions as they\nnow are however it seems to me it would be\nvery unwise to carry out this plan so we are cancelling it completely.\nWe gave up the apartment and Kitsi is going home and will\nstay there\nuntil\ngeneral conditions are more satisfactory and the situation out\nhere is\nsafer. Neither of us is very happy over this but it is the\nonly solution.\nThe game out here is getting too rough and I do not\nwant her bere in Hongkong\nin a ringside seat.\nI have not idea how\nit is going to work out or what is going to happen next but at least\nI will\nnot\nhave to worry about her.\nAlso it seems quite evident\nthat I shall spend considerably less time in Hongkong in the future\nthan I have in the past so there is no point in her being here if\nI cannot get here with reasonable regularity.\nKits has been a good\nsport and a good soldier and it has been wonderful having her out\nfor this long but it is no place for her now. She would worry\nherself sick.\nBesides she will have been away from the baby for\nseven months and that is long enough.\nI do not want him to\nnot knowing either\none of us.\nIt has been a\ngrand\nexperience pop\nKitsi\nand no doubt by the time she starts telling it to her grand\nchildren it will have reached legendary proportions.\nI feel very gARateful\nto PAA for sending her out. No doubt when she gets back to the States\nshe will find some excuse for getting up to New York and will see you and",
