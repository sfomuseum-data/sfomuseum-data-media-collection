I warn you not to\nbelieve more than half she says.\nThe show out here was going along beautifully up to the time the\nJaps shot Woods down and I had visions of\ngetting out of the red\nbefore the end of the year. It was too good to las t.\nNot having a regular Clipper service just now, while bad in many\nways, has\nbeen a help to me in others. It has\nenabled me to\npostpone\nand procrastinate on katers letters that should have been written\nsooner but\nwhich for some raason I have not felt like writing.\nWhen I\nfirst\ngot here I caught a cold which I could not shake off\nhad to go to bed for three days. Then I discovered that when Danny\nCollinsput in a bridge for me two years ago the tooth he pulled\nhad broken\nand Danny had left the root in.\nI am still under\nconstruction with that.\nAlso\nI developed some ear trouble and\nfinally went to a doctor who discovered I had two small boils down\ninside my ear close to the ear drums\nIt was not important but it\nhurt like\nthe deuce.\nI was worse than Jonah and Lazarus but all\nof\nthese served one very excellent purpose that made them worbh while.\nThey\nacted as a counter irritant that enabled me to view with\ncomplete\nindifference the numerous foolish proposals of the Minstry\nOf Communications and others.\nThe doctor and the dentis both say\nthey will be through with me\nthis week so I guess\nI will\nsoon be\nwearing that worried look again.\nRoyal Leonard, who got married here Saturday, has left the General.\nThere was no hard feeling. The madame gave him two beautiful letters\none of\nrecommendation and one of thanks for his services.\nHe xants\nwas coming to work for CNAC and still wants to but on account of\nrestricted flying I am not sure we need him.\nI am to let him know\ndefinitely the end of this month.\nI wish there were some way we could\ntransfer Sharp to PAA, he has earned it, so as to make room for\nLeonard here.\nLeonard is just about as good as Sharp and so good\nthat I would like to see him in the PAA organization somewhere.\nI\nwould like\nto see\nSharp get a chance on the big equipment with PAA\nand he ought to\nstart now in some place where he can begin training.\nWell I guess it is no use butting my head against that stone wall.\nIn a recent letter you said you planned to come\nout here in the near\nfuture. I certainly hope you carry this idea out. Please give my\nbest to Mrs. Bixby and all the family.\nSincerely,\nAarly",
