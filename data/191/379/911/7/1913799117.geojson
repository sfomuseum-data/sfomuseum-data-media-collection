We therefore\nsent Leonard\ninstructions\nto return that night with Sharp. I sent Sharp a measage\nget a floodlight that would work from a storage battery, and be prepared to\nChungking with Leonard.\nThey both arrived about nine o'clock on\nI discussed the situation with them and they\ncould be done.\nLeonard who had been flying nearly all night\nwent up\nto\nwhere I live and went to bed.\nHe sent Nich to Chengtu with the\nflood\nlight and\na lot of lanterns to arrange for the lights and to have gas\nand o11\nand\n₴.\nservice crew on the field.\nJust as Sharp was leaving the",
