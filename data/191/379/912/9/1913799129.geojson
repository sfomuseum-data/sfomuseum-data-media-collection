    "media:imagetext": "Chungking\nNov. 3,\n1938\nDear\nBix:\nI am waiting here at the office for Francis Pan who promised to come\nby to see me about\nseven o'clock, and as I have over an hour I will start this\nto you.\nI tried\ngo out\nto see Mr. Pan but he had to attend the Peoples Conference\nwhich has\nbeen going on here for several days, so he said he would drop in here\nafter it was over.\nthis Peoples Conference I am all for it.\nIt met in Maxgkax\nHankow about\nthree or\nmonths ago and it brought forth some\nvery constructive\ncriticisms on the Ministry of Railways and Communications•\nIt had Dr. H.\non the carpet the\nother day end grilled him for three hours. The point in dispute\nwas why he had placed his son David in charge of the Central Trust.\nConference is\ncomposed\nsome of the ablest and most independent people in\nAnother item of\ngossip around here\nis that China and the Soviets are not\ngetting along too well at the moment and that China may more or\nfrom Russia.\nThe Russians\nseem to be getting much consideration from\nanyone just now. Everyone seems to be climbing on the German band wagon.\nHoch der Hitler•\nAnyway I hear Dr. Kung made a deal with the Soviets for\nmunitions in\nagreed to pay for the\ntransportation in Sterling or\nPefused to pay except in Mex at the official rate. Unfortunately\nthe munitions were sold on credit which sort of cramped the Doctors style.\nI have written Mr. Morgan all the official dope there is so I know you\nare fairly well informed. I used the term advisedly because actually things are\nin the deuce of a mess but I have tried not to make my letters to pessimistic\nas I did not wish to appear to be doing too much complaining. I do enough as\nit is.\nThe chief trouble is, I am afraid, that either I am not bearing down like I\nshould, or that I am getting\nstale, or that I have been neglecting details too\nmuch. Anyway now that Ixkaxa kad am having time to go into things more,\nthere are many\nthings which I have been overlooking and which I do not wish to\ntackle. There\nhave been many occasions\nwhen I have felt that I was neglecting\nmy work and there have been other occasions when I should have handled details\ndifferently but did not because I was I was simply following the line of least\nI do not think I have been working hard enough to hurt me and my living\nconditions have been alright.\nI think the main trouble is that there is never\na chance to let up and relax. And I have to confess that I have a strong urge\nevery now and then to see my Kid. It has been about fifteen months sined I saw\nhim and that is a long time at his age. I had had strong hopes of being able to\nget home for Christmas but they are beginning to grow very dim although I have not\ngiven them up entirely yet.\ntwo operations problems, gasoline and spare parts, and we have one\npolitical or business problem, the adjustment of routes between Eurasia and CNAC\nnow that\nthe available area has been so\ngreatly reduced.\nRegarding the gas, we\nhave about one hundred and forty thousand gallons in Ichang and it looks like it\nis going to\nbe a race between the Japanese\ngetting there end our getting it out.\nSocony has a boat there ready which can carry forty thousand\ngallons per trip but",
