    "media:imagetext": "is still too high for this small boat to get up the Gorges.\nexpect to\nstart any day.\nJust now at Chungking we are borrowing gas from the\nCommission five thousand gallons at the time and having to argue and\nbeg for it each\nRegarding spare\nparts this is going to be less complicated for a while\nbecause we do\nnot have to worry about the Commodores and the Dolphis and the\nStinsons.\nThey are only doing about one third of the flying they were doing and\nif the Japanese\ntake Ichang the Commodores will probably entirely so all we\nconsider are\nthe DCtwosâ€¢\nUnfortunately owing to the uncertainty\ndifficulty we were having in getting US dollars and the delay and the\nlarge amount already in Hongkong for which CNAC owed PASCO, I cancelled all orders\nalready sent in and\nsending in any more. However now that we have cleared up\neverything in Hong Kong I think it is safe to order what we need so we\nworking on some orders that will cover our needs in this respect.\nRegarding the adjustment of routes this is going to be a tough problem.\nCNAC is flying Chungking Ichang three times per week and getting full loads out of\nIchang of evacuees but this will end soon and apparently the Japanese are pushing\nIchang with\nlittle resistance.\nThat leaves us with\nChungkingxxxd\nChengtu,\nand Chungking Kurming both of which are booming and I think will bring us\nnearly\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars per month alone. We are also\ntrying\nto get into Hanoi from Chungking which I think will stand two xank trips\nper week with\nprobably seventy percent capacity. All of this will keep CNAC\nin business very confortably and allow a small profit if we can continue to buy\nUS dollars at the\nrate for our needs. We are also flying once a week to\nHongkong at night loaded to capacity but when we get into Hanoi we plan to out\nthat out.\nEurasia is flying Hanoi Kunming twice a week with low percentage because\nof the railway service\ncompeting. They also fly Kunming Chengtu and get very little\nnow that we are flying Chungking Kunming. They are also\nflying Chengtu Sian and\nSian Lanchow ank but not getting much revenue. In September and October, after they lost\ntheir Hongkong Hankow service I understand their losses were terrific and they are\nall scared. They forget the big losses CNAC had when the wer started and we loss all our\nlines and had to develop others and how we were not allowed to share the Hankow\nHongkong line with Eurasia.\nActually Eurasias lines are nearly as good as ours and\nI am certain Eurasia could develop a profitable business with what they have if they\nhandled it properly but Eurasia as you know has its own systen of dissipating its\nprofits\nand\nits reserve sol\nthat although it has had more revenue all this year\nthan CNAC and should have a big reserve it is just about on the rocks and the\nMinistry is faced with the\nprospects of subsidizing them and the Ministry hasnt\nthe money. To try to talk justice or contract or logic to the Minister or the\nMinistry\nwould be\nlike- well the most useless thing you can think of, so I guess\nthere will be some sort of compromise but just now I am protesting like the .\ndeuce and threatening all\nsorts of things. I hope in the end to obtain, 1) not too\ngreat competition from Eurasia in schedules and the ability to reduce that through\nsuperior operations and equipment, 2) the five year extension of our contract , IN\nWRITING, 3) the the recognition as being permanent\nour newly developed lines\nChungking Hongkong and Chungking Kunming, 4) the Eurasia competition to cease when\nthe war is over.\nThat is my idea of wishful thinking.\nAnyway to get back to my original idea, if I can get these items settled",
