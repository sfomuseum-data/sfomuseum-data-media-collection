I lope you will approve\nbecause I really\nthink I need to get away from this show for a chanceto catch my breath.\nIf this can be\narranged I would like to fly home some where around the tenth\nto the fifteenth of next month.\nGosh just thinking about that gives me a shiver.\nI guess this is about long enough.\nFrancis Pan has just called to say he\nstill in conference but would meet me at eight, but I told him it was so late\nthat it would be an imposition to ask him to come to my office to night so I would\nsee him in the morning at his office.
