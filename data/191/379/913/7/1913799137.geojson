    "media:imagetext": "Chungking\nNov. 5, 1938\nPersonal\nand\nConfidential\nMr. H. M. Bixby\nPan American Airways\nNew York, N. Y.\nDear Bix:\nYour long personal letter of Oct. 17th was received yesterday, coming up\non the plane from Hong Kong that morning• I an enclosing in\nthis envelope another\npersonal letter which I had written to you two days ago but am writing this now\nto reply to some specific questions raised in your letter and also because I was\nto get your lotter and I feel inspired to answer it.\nWith the\nexperience I have had\nin the New York office and with what you\nmentioned I can easily imagine the general\nsituation just now although no doubt I\ndo not do\nthe subject full justice.\nI have my troubles but I will keep them and\nyou can have yours.\nIn a letter to Mr. Morgan written last night and going forward by this\nmail I outlined our present general\nsituation particularly with respect to getting\ninto Hanoi, a\npoint mentioned in your letter.\nI will only add that we are fully\nalive to the\ninherent risks connected with\nflying\ninto Hongkong under the present\nconditions and we are doing and have been doing all possible to complete the\nnecessary arrangements\nfly into Hanoi.\nI have personally discussed the matter\nwith DR. Kung,\nT.V. Soong and the Minister of Communications.\nI started on Aug• 24th\nthe day\nWoods\nWas\nshot\ndown and have been following it up closely.\nIt would take the\nweoght of several years off of me\nto get into Hanoi\njust now. I think we will but\nI do not know when.\nReferring to your comments\non CNAC being behind schedule in payments I\nam glad to say that thás condition has greatly improved since you wrote your letter.\nWe have collected for the two cyclone engines, the DCIwo center\nsection, have\ncompleted the payments on\nthe Commodores and have added about US$10,000.00\nto\nCNAC's fixed deposit making a total deposit of approximately US$20.000.00.\nThis\nhowever I am afraid is about as far as I can go, except of course, getting the money\nfor spare parts orders when they arrive in Hongkong•\nRegarding tka credits through\nthe American Export \u0026 Import Bank it would of course be very helpful but it seems\nto me the detail for such an arrangement would be tremendous and there is really no\ntelling what obstacles\nthe Ministry would put in the way. They certainly would want\na percent for permitting the credit.\nI know of a foreign group who had the reputation\nand the capital who approached the\nMinistry of Communications recently with an offer\nto put twenty new three ton truck into\nservice out of Kunming, freight there is\npiling up terribly,\nif the Ministry would give them free rights during the war.\nThe\nMinister demanded\ntwenty percent of the gross revenue as a tax for the Ministry and\nstuck to it and the deal fell through. You would think that as great as their need for\ntransportation is now\na responsible trucking company would be offered a subsidy.\nAlso I do not think the situation out here is such that any one could offer credit to\nCNAC or the Ministry. I think we shall just have to fight it out along the lines we\no 2201",
