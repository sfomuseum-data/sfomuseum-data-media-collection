    "media:imagetext": "Page 2\nwe have\nfor the past year.\nIt is not much\nof a system but at least we know\nto depend\non our own efforts and we act accordingly. I do not put much\ntrust in anything else just now.\nRegarding your suggestion that it might be possible to carry\nHongkong and make enough off of the exchange\nconsidered several such schemes but they are not practicable. Our planes\nhave to pass a\nvery rigid Customs\ninspection now both at Chungking going and coming\nand also in Hongkong by Chinese Inspectors.\nAlso the Chinese\nGovernment has taken\nover all import\nand export business and you must have a permit for each shipment.\nWe would have to have a permit for each shipment, giving all details and the\nmust be in foreign currency.\nCollections must be paid,\nin foreign currency to the\nMinistry of Finance,\nCentral Trust, who will remit to the shipper or vendor in\nNational Currency at\nthe official\nThe profit on the exchenge goes to the\nMinistry of Finance.\nRegarding the Clipper continuing to fly into HOngkong I agree with you\nsituation has not been changed by the occupation of\nSouth China and\nno change in policy is called for. In fact\nas you say as the Japanese move\ninto South China there will be less flying around over the ocean by Japanese planes.\nand the Clipper will\ncome in behind the flying.\nHowever this is only a\nprinciple and\ndoes not cover all the details. The Japanese navy no doubt will continue to have\noutside and will\nfly planes from it.\nThat is certain but at least the\nsituation is no worse. However since you asked me I\nwould like to offet one\nsuggestion.\nI understand PAA does not advise the Japanese in anyway regarding their\nschedules and flights.\nI may be misinformed but anyway I think they\nshould. I do\nnot think any sovereign right is\ninvolved nor would I be too much of a stickler\nif it was.\nI am in complete disagreement with those who maintain that since no\nwar has been there declared there is no war and the Japanese auxx cannot do certain\nthings which they might have the right to do if war had been declared.\nentirely by what I have seen I am convinced there is a war and the theorist can say\nwhat they\nAlso the war is absolutely vital to the Japanese and they are\ntaking it very\nAlso in spite of many cases of individual, and collective,\nbrutality, I think on the whole they have respected the rights of Americans as much\nas the Germans or the English did before we got into the world war, and probably mon\nthan the French and English did after we got into it. However that is not important.\nIf PAA regularly advises\nthe Japanese of their schedules and flights in my opinion\nit will be a very decided added safety factor and that is of the utmost importance.\nRegarding Allison I can easily understand how difficult it is for PAA to\nplace kin a man of his position on short notice.\nAllison appreciates\nthat but the offer which PAA did make him immediately after the war was made at a\ntime when his wife was having a baby and everything was in confusion and it not\nregister very\nclearly with him at that time and unfortunately it never has properly\nAllie has a rather single track mind as you know. An admirable taait\nin some respects but rather difficult at times in others.\nI have told him that\nif and when he\nto the States he goes to see PAA he will be surprised\nat the cordial welcome he will get and pleased with the efforts that will be made\nin his behalf.\nI guess that covers.\nraid alarm here has sounded\nlettethis\nbuilding is\nbomb proof.\nK anch",
