I put chairs against the doors of our bed-\nroom\nto\nstop\nfxox\nthem from rattling, but I slept o.K.\nThe Chinese certainly have been putting up a grand fight around here.\nMore power to them.\nAmá»™h\nEverything at 279 is perfectly O.K.\nLi and the coolie were on the job.\ncame\naround and\ngave her two months pay and told her to try to find another\njob as I\ndidn't know when you would be back.\nShe said she would come back to you\nwhen you\ndid.\nI paid the\nhouse rent for Oct. and Nov.\nBix paid it for Sept.\nI\noffered the house on a\ntemporary basis to Karl Hill for $200.00.\nThat's all he\ncan pay.\nIf\ncomes back and want it he will take it.\nThey will use their\nown silver and linens.\nI am going to leave all our flat silver with Max Polin.\nThat is all I can do now.\nI must be back in Nanking Wednesday. Out outlook\n(Company) is\ntough.\nThere is a great deal of misunderstanding.\nThe most important\nChinese\nthink\nran\nout on them.\nI have accomplished a little but not much",
