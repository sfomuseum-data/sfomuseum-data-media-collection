Long, wife of our Bolane airport\nmanager,\nWillkie, and Mr. Trippo.\nNaturally, I never expeeted to\ndine in darkest Africa with or without Mr. Willkie, nor least of all,\nI suspoot,\ndid Mra. Long.\nShe was the daughter of a Scotchman who spent\nmany yesre\nat Horts.\nThere she net and married Long, and they seened\nto be an ideal\ncouple to send to Bolena for both speak Portuguese.\nWe had enough beds for all at the ataff house.\nwe boarded \u0026 small steambost as the guests of the Governor,\nmainland and\nmiles.\nWish you could have seen me sitting in that truck on a box with\na sun helmet on my head and an Army rifle over my nees while me rattled\nover a winding red clay road through the jungle.\nwas with me\nand in the sane truck two Portuguese officers, neither of\nwhon could speak English but both of whom could speak French about as\nwell me I\nIt was something of a strain linguistically and physically.\nMy rifle,\nwhich weighed about 20 lba., was a \"three man gun\"-one nan\nholds the rifle and two men hold him.\nFortunately we only saw many\nmonkeys and one small gasolle which was out of range.\nI say \"fortunately\"\nfor I wouldn't have shot that gun for all the tes in China,",
