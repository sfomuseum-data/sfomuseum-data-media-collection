China by pilots at the end of their home leave).\nThe life of Puerto\nRico is so similar\nto the Philippines as to be startling.\nNo doubt this is due to the ipanish influence for Spain lost both islands\nto us in 1893.\nAnother factor is the economy-sugar is the predominant\ncrop, with rice, tobacco and coconut producte.\nThe following day, Thursday fly 20th,\nthe CNAC C-47 (like a DC-3\norily with bucket seats along each side of the cabin) arrived from Miami and\nwe departed early Friday morning, following the islands wich run all the\ncoast of South America.\nIt is a beautiful flight starting with\nthe Virgin Islands, which we bought fron Denmark for $25,000,000 (which 03%,",
