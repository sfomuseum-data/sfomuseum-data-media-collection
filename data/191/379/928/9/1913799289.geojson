Jeff Morris\n20 Miles Street\nSanta Crus, California\nDear Betty:\nI am leaving on the 17th for a trip to Cairo and Capetown,\nand will not be back until the middle of November. In the in-\nterim, I have asked our people to keep you inforued of any re-\nport fron India or Burma.\nHowever,\nsince your recent telephone call, I have had a\nfurther talk\nwith Mr. Bond, who is home on leave, and with one\nof our CNAC pilots, both of whom are thoroughly faniliar with\nthe circumstances\nsurrounding Jeff's disappearance.\nBondy con-\nfirmed the statement which I believe I have previously made to\nyou; nemely, thet shortly efter Jeff'e plane took off, a violent\nand unpredieted storn\noccurred about halfway between Caleutte\nand Sadiya in a heavily wooded, mountainous area near the Indian-\nBurne border.\nNo announcement has been mede, so fer as I know, but for\nyour confidential information, eight Army plenes were lost that\nsame night in the same storm.\nSeveral of the Army planes were\nlater found, some of them as much as 250 miles apart, so that\nit would appesr that the storm covered a wide ares.\nEvery attempt\nwas made by the Aray, as well as by CNAC, to find the lost air-\ncraft.\nParatroopers were carried extensively over the area, and\nthe few planes that were found were located by paratroopers who\nparachuted down in the neighborhood of points in the jungle where\ntreetops had been eut off, or bits of airplane wreckage could be\nsighted from the air.\nI have felt, and I know that Mr. Bond shares this view,\nthe only chance for Jeff wes the possibility that he might heve\nsurvived a crash, and been taken\nprisoner by the Japanese,\ncolumns at that time were reported to be in the ares.\napparent now that Jeff did not survive the sccident, nor did any-\none else in the airplane.\nIt is, naturally,\nwith the greatest\nreluetance that I write the above, but I am sure you, Betty,\nwould\nrather know the truth than be led on by false or unwerrented assump-\ntions, such as the one that reached you to the effect\nthat Jeff might\nbe a prisoner of the Lolos.
