The priests were con-\nducting sore kind of service and the big church was chook full of deeply\nreligious Mexicans, mostly of the peon type.\nBack at the airport, we\ngot away on a DC-3 operated by Cia Mexicans, and now as I write, were\nflying over the bay of Campeche toward Merida.\nArriving Merida about 4130 p.m., we were met by the PAA menager and\na representative of the Barbschano tourist bureau, who suggested that we\nleave right away for Chichen Itzs, some one hundred miles east of keride\nin the center of the province of Tucatan.\nWe drove into Merida from the\nchanged curs, and with our English-speaking guide-chauffeur started\nour trip about 5:00 p.m.\nsunset behind us and high-piled white\nclouds ahead provided daylight for about half the\njourney over \u0026 fine road.\nHe drove through flelds of \"green god\"\nas they cell the sisal plantations,\nthen stretches of\njungle, fields of corn and little villages of thetched\nhuts--clean as a mistle, as were the people, too.\nWe stopped at a little\nbarrio for a coca cola,\nwhere the \"manager\"\npresented Debby\nwith a beeutiful\nwhite flower which looked like an orchid and\nsmelled like a gardenia - then\ncontinued in the dark.\nCattle gresing along the road were such a hazard that\nour driver - thank\ngoodness - could not speed even if he had\nwanted to do so.\nThe lest ten miles of road was very\nrough going but entirely sefe and\npassable.\nWe arrived at the ruins about\n8:00 p.m.,\nand our guide turned off\nhis headlights for a few moments\nthat we could\nsee the pyramid and the\ntemple of warriors by moonlight - a never-to-be-forgotten impression.\nlodge ie unique.\nA central dining room\nwith spacious porch is set in a grove\nof large trees and interspersed\nwith orange, line, lenon and\ngrapefruit trees,\nplus flowering shrubs,\nbougainvilla, and other flowering vines.\nwalk led down to an\noval-shaped stucco thatch-roofed cottege\nsurrounded by \u0026\nbroad porch under the extensive overhang of the roof.\nInside a partition\ndivided the oval room into a bedroom and\nMost attractive and appropriate.",
