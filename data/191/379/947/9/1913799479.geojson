Bondy and I plan to go\nover\nthere\nSunday\nthe 12th and spend a few days.\nwill probably try to get\nthe Government to\ncomplete an air strip which is already partially con-\nstructed.\nWill call on Gellion and our other friends over there.\nOf course\nif a green light is\nreceived fron Shanghai will come right back.\nMy views\nregarding the whole Chinese situation have\nchanged\nsince\narriving here and\ntalking to American, British and Chinese officials.\nI had\nhoped that it might be possible\nfor\nthe Nationalists to get together\nand hold\n\"beach-head\" somewhere in South China.\nOf course anything can happen as\nevidenced by\nthe man who\nnow sits in the White House.\nBut the situation\nappears absolutely hopeless.\nChiang Kai-shek will not let go.\nHe is still\nplaying one\npolitical leader against another so\nthat none will\nemerge to\nchallenge his position.\nGeneral L:\nthe seting President and\nGeneral Pal\nwere the former strong men of Kwangsi,\nthe model Province.\nThe Generalissimo\nis afraid\nthat they may agein gain complete control of Kwangsi\nand\nbreak away\nfrom the so-celled\n\"Central Goverament\",\nso he has ordered General\nPal\nto make\na stend with his Kwangsi troops at lleng Tang south of Changsha on the Hankow-\nCanton Esilroad.\nChiang hopes -\nthey say - that General\nPai and his troops\nwill be taken by\nthe Conmunists and\nthus unable to retreat to Kwangsi.\nAt\nleast that is\nthe opinion of some usually well-informed\npeople.\nYou remember\nthe old proverb - \"Brothers stop quarrelling when\nthere's a tiger at the door.\"\nWell,\nthe\nNationalists are not following that idea and the concensus of\nopinion is that\nthe Communists will\ntake\nCanton just as soon as their troops\nhave time\nto walk that far.\nThere may be a few provinces which will hold out\nfor months or maybe years against the\nCommunists but they\nare in the west and\nnorthwest\nbeyond\nthe reach of rail or river traffic and of little importance\nto\ntrade.",
