Bixby\nBolton Landing\nNew York\nDear Mrs. Bixby:\nI return herewith the original letter from Mr. Bixby\nwhich I have\ncopied and mailed to your daughters as per your\nrequest.\nConcerning your inquiry re foreign stamps\n- yes,\nwe do\ncollect them for a gentleman who stops in (rather in-\nfrequently) for this purpose and who also distributes them\nto veterans.\nSince the preponderance of our foreign mail\noriginates in China we accumulate largely Chinese stamps; I\nenclose some to add to your\nnext group.\nA letter has arrived from Mr. Bixby written June 10th\nand, as requested in an accompenying note, I enclose copies\nfor yourself and your daughters or whatever use you may wish\nto put them to.\nAs instructed by Mr.\nBixby, I also furnished\ncopies to Mr. Ingalls and the Dunlops in Chevy Chase.\nMr. William Lyons unexpectedly 'phoned yesterday to say\nhe was in town until tomorrow and to advise that the sub-lease\nproposal for next winter was entirely agreeable to him.\nAt\nthe same time he stressed the importance of the Management\nbeing kept out of the arrangements.\nMeanwhile, your\nletters\non this same subject arrived and I immediately\ncontacted Mr.\nLyons and read your messages to him.\nHe planned to\n\" phone\nyou this afternoon since he departs New York tomorrow.\nNew York has been stifling this\npast week,\nbut a breeze\nhas struck up now making it more\nlivable.\nAfter almost three\nweeks drought we had a little rain last night, not enough,\nhowever,\nto undo the damage to our lawn and garden which are\nvery parched.\nP.S.\nSincerely,\nAacqueline Tagan\nWas immensely pleased to hear that The Case of the\nMissing Cufflinks et al had been solved ! ! !",
