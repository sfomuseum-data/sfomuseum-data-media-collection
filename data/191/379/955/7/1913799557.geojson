    "media:imagetext": "1\nJuly 24, 1949\nDear Family,\nI think that my last letter covered this trip as far as Japan.\nWe are now\nflying fron Karachi, Pakistan to Danaseus, Syria - an eight-hour,\nnon-stop jump\nof over 2,000 miles.\nFron Japan we flew to Okinawa and Hongkong.\nA short trip\nto Canton, three trips to Manila and one back to Tokyo, then on to Bengrok where\nI stayed four days.\nThat is a most interesting and pleasant place.\nThe temples\nare magnificent and the people so courteous and friendly that it is refreshing.\nEveryone seems so glad to see you and even the taxi drivers say \"thank you\" in\nmarked contrast with the sullen gas jockeys of Manhattan.\nI saw all the Cabinet\nMinisters and the Prime Minister.\nAlso had a private, for-ne-only tour through\nthe Royal Palace accompanied by an under Secretary who knew the whole history\nand spoke perfect English.\nThe Emerald Buddhe temple is one of the great sights\nof the world.\nIt and other temples are closed to the public now because the\nPalace grounds were chosen by the leaders of the most recent \"coups d'etat\" as\nthe base of their military operations, and they do not propose to be thrown out\nthe way they got in.\nYou will remenber that the young king was mysteriously\nmurdered a few years ago.\nHis body was put in a big earthenware jar and there\nit must remain until his younger brother returns fron Switzerlend.\nThe Y.B.\nseems to prefer his safe, comfortable Tyrolean bonnet rather than the fourteen\ncarat dangerous hardware which was shot off the unhappy head of his late older\nbrother.\nApparently he has no intention of coming hone.\nSo,\nthe funeral pyre\non which the body of the late King will be cremated stands weathered and dila-\npidated outside the Palace grounds.\nWe have just flown over the Texas Company refinery on Behrein Island.\nA\nfloating pipeline runs out to sea where five tankers were taking on oil.\nbeyond Behrein is enother great oil producing center - Dhahran, within sight\nof which there are seven fields, each of which is larger than any other in the\nworld.\nThe Anglo-Irenian pipeline is being built (by Leif Sverdrup of St. Louis)\nfrom here to Beirut.\nIt is just possible that while the Russian dog is barking\nat Berlin, the Russian dog that doesn't bark - but may bite - is lurking silent\nin this vast desert space below us.\nAt Menila I met a Sianese-Chinese named Chulind who gave me a Chinese\nluncheon party at Bangkok followed by a pienie boatride on the river. It really\nwas a great treat.\nThe river traffic is much like Canton where people are born,\nlive and die on boats.\nTe stopped at the Temple of the Dawn and climbed up\nsome stairs to ge a view of Bangkok.\nI stayed at the Trocadero Hotel.\nDuring my first night there my uneasy\nsleep on a concrete mattress with pillow to match was broken by\nthe most terrific\nyowling of dogs which were being killed in a cleanup empaign.\nFortunately they\ngot most of them the first night, because the din was not so bad on subsequent\nYou know, in British sphere countries they have three initial designations:\n\"H.E.\" which is \"His Excellency\", and when they get \u0026 little higher up on the\nATELLISIAOS",
