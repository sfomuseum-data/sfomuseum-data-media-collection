Fur-\nthermore,\nthey promised that the \"People's Governmentâ„¢ would advance enough money\nevery month to meet all expenses including the saleries of all American flight\nand ground personnel.\n(Theyll have \u0026 chance to make good on that promise at\nthe end of Novenber 1)\nNext the Hongkong police put a guard on all airplenes.\nThe Chinese Civil Aeronsuties Administration cancelled all licenses.\nThe Op-\nerations Department drained all gesoline (as fire prevention) frow the tanks, and\nso it looks as though the remaining airplanes are really grounded.\nThe trouble within CNAC is just a small repetition of the trouble in China,\nand we are as unable to cure the one as we are the other.\nOne of these days\nChungking will fall - then Kunming and then Formoss (which until the peace treaty\nis still Japanese territory) alone will remin.\nKhether Chiang Kai-shek and his\nhangers-on will try to hold formosa against strikes, insurrections, sabotage and\nCommnist infiltration -\nif not sctual invasion - or whether he and his cohorts\nwill divide up the considerable Central Bank of China reserves and slip away to\nsome country\nwilling to harbor them remains to be seen.\nOne thing is sure,\nChiang\nKai-shek and his party have forfeited not only the ability to rule but also the\nright\nrule.\nUnfortnately,\nthe people have no choice but the Communiets and\nthere is no doubt but that a very large majority are for the new regime - not\nbecause of\nCommunism but in spite of it - and on the thory that any form ofgor-\nerment\nis better than what they have had.\nsome of you will renember\n0.
