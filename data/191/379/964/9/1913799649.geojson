    "media:imagetext": "Sunday\nJanuary 8, 1950\nDear Family,\nWe left Paris by logon Lits Friday night, arriving Brussels\nearly Saturday morning.\nTook off in a Constellation with thirty-five\nof its forty-one seats\nfilled at 5:00 pm,\nflew down the Rhone Valley\nto Marseilles,\nacross Corsica to Rome - Naples - Athens, across Cyprus,\nover Beirut and after a nine hour flight arrived\nat Damascus at 2:00\na.m.\nthis morning.\nOne of the drawbacks to my\ntravel in the past has been the\nfact that I never quite enjoy any experience because I always\nwish\nSO\nmuch that the family were along to enjoy it too.\nWell, this time they\nare - or at least the one most important member and ith of the\nothers -\nor I should say 1/7th because the two Bills and Sam Ere included.\nWe thought Damascus would not be crowded but it was.\nwe had to sit up until 5:00 a.m.\ncrawl into beds newly made up\nafter a plane departure at\nthat hour.\nuntil about 10:00 a.m.,\nhad breakfast in our room not rooms - because Hebe was quartered with\nand then went out on the town with an English-speaking guide\nAbraham Baho, a Syrian Christian.\n(When Hebe had trouble pronouncing\nhis last name he said,\n\"Just call me 'Abraham'.\") Debby and Hebe were\nenthusiastic over the native city - the Bazzar with its wonderful\nshops and the second largest mosque in the world - the old church\nJohn the Baptist.\nWe saw the over-sized tomb which\nthe head of John the Baptist,\nwe also saw the tomb of\nSaladin.\nThen we went all through the\nex-sultan's palace and\nsaw the quarters\nwhere his thirty-five wives lived.\nOur guide told us\nseveral times\nthat the wives were never permitted to leave\nthe palace,\nbut to me\nthat repetition was unnecessery.\nIf those thirty-five wives had got\nloose in those shops in the Bazzar the sultan would probably have become\na priest after the bankruptcy\nproceedings!\nAfter a drive down the\nStreet\ncalled Straight we had\nlunch - very\ngood - then drove about\ntwenty-five miles out along the excellent highway which runs to\nBagdad,\nturned off to a little mountain town called Malulah where\nthere is a small\ncommunity\nthe members of which - some five hundred\nstrong\nstill speak the language of Christ.\nFor over 2,000 years\nthey have lived at the end of a fertile\nvalley with their village at\nthe sheltered end\nand their Roman Catholic monastery high above on\nthe mountainside.\nWe reached the church by walking up \u0026 narrow gorge\ncut in the massive rocks by a mountain stream which was still there.\nAlong the\ntrail\nthere were numerous caves, hollowed\nout of the solid\nrock back in\nthe days when the Romans were there.\nAt the top,\nthe\nShangri-la like monastery wes surrounded by hills many oi which were\nsnowce pped.\nBishop - as fine a\nlooking character as you ever\nsaw - had us served with twenty year old\nwine and gave us some unleavened bread and\ncheese - all very good\nindeed, especially the wine.\nThe latter is made on the place from\ntheir\nown vineyards.",
