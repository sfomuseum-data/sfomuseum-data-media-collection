No. 1.\nHe apologized for not getting us into\nthe best hotel,\nbut we are delighted with the Pera Palace.\nDebby\nand I have a red draped bedroom with a twelve foot ceiling; the\nroom is filled with German furniture of the 190's; a bathroom\nlarger than the average bedroom - slightly on the cold side on\naccount of because one window is broken and the paper in lieu of\nglass is loose at the bottom; a living room done in brocade panels\nwith heavy framed Germanic paintings, four high windows complete\nwith heavy twelve foot arapes and more ponderous German furniture.\nI'm sure that the Kaiser must have stayed here when he visited\nTurkey in 1899.\n(Found out later that he did! )\nWe're waiting now\nfor a car and\nguide.\nOutside it is snowing, but the snow melts as\nit hits.\nA string of cars moves by in constant procession three\nfloors below, and\neach driver leans on the horn continually.\nDebby says each minute is like New Year's Eve.\nIt's now 9:30 a.m.\nand we're anxious to get going for if the plane from London is on",
