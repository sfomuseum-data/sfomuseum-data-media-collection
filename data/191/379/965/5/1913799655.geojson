    "media:imagetext": "-2-\nschedule this will be our only day in Istanbul.\nIwo days later\nWe made the rounds of Istanbul including the famous mosque\nof St.\nSophia.\nHebe knew all about it from her\ncollege training and\nof course it was a great day for her.\nIt is the third largest church\nin\nthe world -\noutranked\nonly by St. Peters\nin Rome and St. Pauls\nin London.\nNear\nSt. Sophia is the smaller but I think more beautiful\nBlue Mosque which has six minarets instead of the conventional four\nbecause of a mistake in the specifications.\nWe also took in the ex-\nSultan's palace\nand saw there the finest collection of Chinese porcelain\nin the world.\nChinese celadons by the hundreds, each one of which in\nitself would be prized by most museums.\nIt seems that many of the old\nSultans ordered lots of china for their extensive kitchens and stored\nit in\nthe\n\"cellar\".\nThe next Sultan ordered more quite unaware of the\nstock already on hand.\n(Governments have a way of doing that!)\nIn\nthe reconstruction of the ancient kitchens great numbers of cases of\nthis porcelain were unearthed and formed this magnificent collection\nconsisting of pieces from the 14th Century through the 18th.\nWe drove around Istanbul and out toward Roberts College\nalong\nthe shore of the Bosphorus.\nWe had lunch at a famous plage\nin the heart of the old city called Pandilla.\nIt is reached\non foot\nup a narrow,\ndirty alley.\nCabinet Ministers and leading businessmen\ntread the alley to get the best food in the Middle East.\nThe owner,\nPandilla,\nis a show in himself, standing behind a\nslightly elevated\ncounter directing the whole operation, greeting his customers as they\ncome and go, shouting orders through a small window to the kitchen\nand directing his weiters around\nthe small dining room.\nNot a detail\nmissed his watchful check - the while he sipped brandy and became\nmore and\nmore mellow as the hour advanced.\nHe gets up at 4:00 a.m.\nand goes\nto\nthe market where he buys the best of everything.\nHe has\nturned down hundreds of offers to open a better restaurant in Is-\ntanbul as well as offers from New York, Paris,\netc.\nHe says that\nhe is doing all\nright where he is and why move!\nDuring\nthe day the snow turned into a snowstorm and then\na blizzard.\nOur\nplane was late starting from Brussels but we went\nout to the airport at 2:00 a.m.\nThe plane came in at 3:00 a.m. and\nwas serviced in a\nreal blizzard, but eventually we were loaded on\nboard after Debby and Hebe had returned the werm clothes which we\nhad borrowed.\nWe taxied out tor the take-off and then taxied back\nbecause number one engine - that's the one on the left - wouldn't\nrun\nproperly.\nThey struggled with it for a while and then postponed\nthe\nflight for repairs and crew rest.\nWe were taken in a\nbus to a\nsmall hotel near the field and there we stayed all day while the\nblizzard continued.\nDebby and Hebe bundled up in blankets off the\nairplane.\nHowever, at 7:00 p.m.\nwe did get away and had an un-\neventful flight, back to Damascus and on to here - Delhi - where we\narrived at noon local time on Friday the 13th.\nTomorrow, Saturday, we are going to drive over to Agra\nabout a four hour trip, to see the Taj Mahal, stay in Agra overnight\nand return\nSunday night.",
