In 1920 the Russian\nReds killed his father.\nThe mother escaped down the Amur in\na small boat with her eight children, was picked up at sea by\na Japanese gunboat and brought to Kobe.\nThere the children\ngot along on next to nothing but survived.\nMy friend went back\nto Manchuria when he was eighteen and worked for his father's\nold firm which had been\ntaken over by some Jews.\nLater he went\ninto business for himself out in Sinkiang Province and ran a\nfleet of\ntrucks along the old silk road from Peiping across\nthe Gobi Desert to Hami,\nTurfan and throughout northwestern\nChina.\nHe made quite a fortune.\nHe had to drop everything\nwhen\nthe Communists took over in China.\nNow his wife is in\nPeiping while he is staying in Kobe with his sister who is\nmarried\nto another wealthy Turk.\nIt was the sister's son who\ndrove the car\na Plymouth.\nThe boy is very good-looking.\nhas lived all his nineteen years in Japan -\nspeaks English like\nan American and Japanese like a Japanese.\nWe started out at 5:00 a.m. in the dark,\nYokohama and going on to the Fugia Hotel at Menoshita\nLeaving there we had our first view of Fuji which,\nthrough the morning haze, looked as red as it is depicted on\nthe Japanese painted pillow covers which the sailors buy in\nLater it was gold color.\nWe stopped at Lake Hakone\nwhere our host, the uncle,\ntook some color films which I hope\nto bring home\nto show you all.\nVie drove all day through little\nJapanese villages and open country over roads sometimes good\nbut often\nin bad shape.\nOne flat tire tied us up in a little\ntown next to a\nsmall\nsawmill.\nThe owner brought us out three\nchairs and we had lunch - beer,\nsandwiches and fried chicken\nwhich we had brought along - sitting in the lumber yard with a\nbeautiful view of nearby Fuji with a warm sun shining out of\na cloudless sky.\nWe drove on through Nagoya, Kyoto and Osaka -\nall big cities - to Kobe where we arrived at 10:30 p.m. some\n400 miles from Tokyo.\nOur host's sister and husband have a large German-\nstyle house on a hillside looking out over the city and bay.\nThe house is surrounded by a lovely Japanese garden.\nThe owner,\nF. Gizatullin,\n(pronounced like it is spelled)\nand his wife\ncouldn't have been more cordial or hospitable.\nThey have five\nother children besides Frederick (our chauffeur),\nthree girls\nand two boys.\nThe children all speak English,\nTurkish and\nJapanese with equal facility but the father's English was not",
