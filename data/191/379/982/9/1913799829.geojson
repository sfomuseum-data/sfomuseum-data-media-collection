Trippe and Whitney who have flown pretty much every-\nwhere both said that the scenic beauty\nof the flight from Hongkong\nsurpassed any\nthey had seen elsewhere.\nGreat masses of stone,\ndeep narrow canyons cut from the solid rock,\nfive hundred foot high\nsmooth moss like hills and this morning the valleys filled\nin spots with fog the color of dirty cotton floating as though poured\nthe\nvalleys by the Gods.\nHere we are flying at 5000 feet in a\nsunlit sky - no clouds, only an Arizona blue in the dome from horizon\nto horizon yet our last weather report from Wenchow reports\nIf the fog does not move out of our way\n- or unere are\nthrough which we can fly down\nto land on the river, we shall\npass up Wenchow and continue on to Foochow.\nWe have just flown over Fenghua a small town where our amah,\nTsing Tzu came from and possibly more entitled to fame as the home of\nChiang Kai-shek,\nwhose private airport lies below us.\nThe Generalissimo\nthere recuperating from his harrowing experiences at Sian-fu.\nIt is said on good authority that after his imprisonment at Sian-fu\nhe refused to confer with his captor Chang Hsuch-liang but quietly said\n\"You are my\notherwise you are\nno reason for conferences.\"\nChiang Kai-shek is proud, fearless, ruth-\nless yet patient.\nHe has given his life to the unification of China-\nan almost,\ned\nif not entirely, impossible task.\nHow heart sick,\ndisillusion\nand altogether miserable he must have been, caged, humiliated,\nand\nbullied by a big headed, swashbuckling subordinate who was actuated by\nmotives almost wholly selfish.\nIt's the old old game of China.\nNo\nplayer will sacrifice the right of individual action for the sake of\nteam play. No player wants to run interference but each wants to carry\nthe ball\nevery\nplay and if anyone on his side is stupid enough to form\ninterference for him that's OK.\nChinese have been individualistic for",
