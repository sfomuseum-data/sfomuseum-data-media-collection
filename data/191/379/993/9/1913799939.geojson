Morgan,\nPan\nAmerican Airways,\nNew York.\nDear Stokeley:\nI was so wrong in my predictions as to the present Sino-\nJapanese trouble that I feel in self defense an explanation is in\norder.\nI do not believe that any well informed parties in Shanghi\nreally anticipated war on any such scale as that at present going\non â€¢\nThe\nactual circumstances to express it in another way,\nwere\nsomewhat\n\"Morgan\nas though Jack Dempsey walked into your office\nget under the desk\"\nYou would first look around for help\nand seeing no one,\ndesk.\nif you had good sense you would get under the\nIf Dempsey\nthen proceeded to kick you in the pants you woud\nthen probably suffer that humiliation as gracefully as possible.\nIf he then came around and spit in your\nface you might or might not\ntake it but if indignities were carried far enough you might then\ncome out from under the desk and sook him if you knew it were the\nlast act of your life.\nThat I believe is about the situation.\nThe\nChinese,\nwho are\nextremely proud, suffered every\nhumiliation\nat the hands of the Japanese until finally they could stand no\nmore and I personally do not believe that any of the responsible\nChinese\nleaders at any time dared hope for victory.\nI personally thought that Chiang Kai-shek would trade it\nout with the Japs,\nagree to a \"show\" in North China which would\nand his own military an opportunity to\nbe pretty well agreed upon before the fight began\nand would probably\ninvolve recognition of the Japanese sphere of influence in North\nChina as well as other concessions.\nThis program I em quite sure\nwas under consideration when the Chire se patience became\nexhausted,\nand they decided instead to come out from under the desk.\nVery sincerely,\nHMB : MF\nH.
