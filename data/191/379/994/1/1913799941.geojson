I.\nDear Mr. Bixby:\nI have just received your memoranda written in Shanghai on\nAugust 20 and on board the SS PRESIDENT PIERCE on August 25, giving a\nvery complete description of what transpired in Shanghai during the days\nimmediately preceding your departure.\nThis serves in a large measure to\nanswer the request made in my letter No. 195 of August 24 for a full re-\nport.\nThere are a few holes you will notice, and which I think on fur-\nther\nconsideration you will want to fill up,\nbut it gives us a pretty\ncomplete picture so\nthat we now know quite well what happened, although\nit will take considerable further study to decide just what our legal\nposition is.\nUnfortunately, you put most of this report in the form of\nand confidential letter containing\na few paragraphs which\nyou yourself stipulated mist be \"off the record\".\nThis, of course, makes\nit useless for record purposes, but I shall probably take the liberty of\nrewriting a few pages as we must have most of this on our files for future\nuse in connection with claims,\nete.--or perhaps you would prefer to write\nanother report with this end definitely in view and with no confidential\nmaterial included.\nIt is very apparent from your reports that you took the only\naction possible under the circumstances,\nand of course we felt certain of\nthis all along.\nYour description of events is most graphic, and in fact\nthe news reels from Shanghai have just reached New York so that we can see\nor at least ingine what you went through.\nIt must have been indeed a\nterrible experience for all concerned.\nReferring to your telegram No. 126 with suggestion for trans-\nferring title to certain equipment no longer in our possession, and billing\nCNAC in the amount of $110,000, I am sure you will understand that our\nreply (telegram No. 112) was written primarily for record purposes.\nI at\nleast,\nand\nI am sure you also, cannot have any illusions as to our Chinese\nassociates viewing the proposed action as highly cooperative, nor,\nI fear,\ncan any of us entertain much\nhope of a renewal of joint activities,\nalthough of\ncourse anything can happen.",
