    "media:imagetext": "Mr. Bixby\n.-\n2 - ,\nSeptember 22, 1937\nUndoubtedly the Generalissimo hoped for the maximum of time\nto complete his preparations and was ready to go to a considerable length\nto stall\noff the hour of the showdown,\nbut I do not think that for the\npast two years he had any expectation of avoiding it by putting up any fake\nshow and final agreement which would involve any material\nexpansion of the\nJapanese sphere\nof influence in China.\nIn other words I do not think, as\nyou say,\nthat\nthe Chinese patience became exhausted, but rather that the\nJapanese,\nJudging the situation correctly, forced the issue when they did\ninstead of\ngiving\nthe General any more time to prepare.\nThis is precisely\nwhat the Central Powers did in 1914 when France and Russia were preparing\nfor a showdown in\n1916 or later.\nThere is considerable talk here and in the papers to the\neffect that the Chinese Government was dragged into this war through pres-\npublic opinion and inability to restrain the army leaders and the\nmasses of the people any longen.\nThis theory does not jibe with the fact\nof the very complete and ample preparation which was made for this eventu-\nality.\nObviously\nthere was a very great public reaction against Japan and\nprobably wide-spread demand for forfeful action, but this undoubtedly could\nhave been controlled by the Government if that had been their policy.\nseems more likely\nIt\nthat in Japan the people were dragged in by the army lead-\ners and this may\nhave important repercussions later.\nI never could see why it was that there was such wide-spread\nopinion among the \"China hands\"\nthat the next incident would not\nseriously\ninvolve Shanghai.\nThere were two controlling reasons,\nto my mind, why the\nJapanese had to attack at Shanghai.\nOne was\nthe necessity of their protect-\ning their great number of nationals there from mob violence, and the second\nwas the important economic consequence to China of\nparalizing and control-\nling its most important commercial city.\nIt was equally certain that the\nChinese would resist any military activity around Shanghai although every-\nbody,\nincluding the Japanese, miscalculated the vigor of the Chinese resist-\nance around that point.\nIn any case, however,\nit seemed to me,\nand I re-\nmember so telling Bond here in July,\nthat far\nfrom being a safe haven, I\nthought the International Settlement might become perhaps the most dangerous\nplace to be in China.\nIt must be only a question of time before antipathy\ntowards Japan will turn into antipathy\ntowards all foreigners--if external\naid is not forthcoming.\nI am not going to be\nfoolish enough to try\nto predict the\nfuture\ncourse of events other than to say that if my theories as above set\nforth are correct,\nit is a certainty\nthat the Chinese resistance will be\nvigorous and long drawn out.\nMuch must depend on the extent of the military\nsupplies\nwhich they have been able to accumulate during the last two or\nyears,\nthree\nand their ability to obtain new supplies in spite of the coastal block-\nade by Japan.\nOnLy\ntime will show the answer to these questions and it seems\nto me that gasoline supplies will be a vital factor since, unless I am mistaken,\nthere is no gasoline production in China, and it would be very difficult at\npresent\nto bring\nthis in except\nthrough\nchannels which the Japanese will al-\nmost certainly be successful in blockading.\nHowever, experience has shown",
