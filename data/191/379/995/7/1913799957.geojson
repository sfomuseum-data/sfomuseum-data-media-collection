Bixby\n-\n3 -\nSeptember 22, 1937\nthat nations manage to get small arm ammunition somehow or other in spite\nthe most rigorous restrictions, and with this type of supplies alone the\nChinese should be able to keep up a devastating guerilla warfare for a\nvery long period.\nAfter all, they have only one chance of winning, or\nshall we say saving themselves, in this war and that is to bleed Japan eco-\nnomically and financially white by forcing her to keep a very large army\nmobile in the field for a long period.\nIf they do,\nsomething is going to\ncrack badly in Japan, I think,\nbefore anything cracks in China.\nIt is for\nthis reason that I cannot believe in any\nreturn to peaceful conditions in\nthe future as far ahead as I can see-which means, of course, that in my\nopinion there is not the slightest chance of our resuming operations or\nparticipating in operations in China even if we were disposed to make the\nnecessary further investment.\nI have felt all along that the possibility of our operating\nnot so much because of the fail-\nare of the chinese to cooperate luoy out 1a beca the top-fad -\nmen would do that in their own interests) but because I felt sure that the\nJapanese would never discriminate between military and conmercial aircraft,\nwith the result that our pilots could not have flown with any reasonable\nin chine so long as Japanese meteor wireal not sette can tati\nif that is correct then we could not safely resume operations\nterritory, even although a state of comparative peace might materialize and\nour Chinese friends should give new and\npossibly more satisfactory assur-\nances of\ntheir willingness to cooperate.\nPossibly you will disagree with a good deal of the above and\nit would be interesting to have your comment, as I make no claims\nto omni-\nscience.\nlating,\nIn any case,\ncorrespondence of this sort is interesting and stimu-\nlike a game of\nchess by cable.\nSincerely yours,\nSVIM: AH",
