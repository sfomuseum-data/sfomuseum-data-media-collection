Wong in as Managing Director we should\nbe able to\nget along much better than we ever have at any time in the past.\nTo sum up the whole situation the vantage of re-association are\n(1) Immediate recognition by the Chinese Government of the value\nof the Amer-\nican shares in CNAC as of July 31st.\n(2) Extension of the contract.\nPurchase of Route 3 (I suggested $300,000 U.S. in order to have a fixed sun\nwhich would at once be recognized as materially below our actual investment\nand at the same time represent an amount which I think we oan get.)\nProvide for immediate payment of the balance of CNAC's account as well as\npurchase of the Dolphing and the purchase of the two Commodores.",
