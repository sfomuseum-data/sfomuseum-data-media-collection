V.\nSoong who have always maintained that the Chinese are not yet\nready to take over their own aviation activities,\nare now prevailing and there\nis an insistent demand on the Ministry that negotiations be undertaken\nthe return of American cooperation and technical assistance.\nт.\nV.\nto assure\nSoong knows\nfor instance that we were forced out by a series of high handed\nand\nsilly\norders\nissued by the Ministry of Communications and there is no doubt in my mind but\nthat he and men like him have had a showdown and have issued an ultimatum to\nLum Wei-shing and the Ministry demanding that such steps be taken as necessary\nwithin reason to bring us back into the\npicture.\nIn our conference at Hongkong\non October 6th Mr. Bond\nsaid that the Managing Director talked of nothing else but\nand P. Y. Wong\npersuading me to re-\nturn with him to Nenking•\nWhen I suggested\nto P..\nY. Wong that Mr.\nBond\ncould\ndo everything that I could hope to accomplish at Nanking, P.\nwas that they wanted the No.\n1 which I\nam sure\n18\nonly a matter of\nNo a copy\nthe M. D. as he must be extremely\nantagonistic\nto\nand\nthe\nbecause of the withdrawal\nof the American interest\nholding \u0026 the D.\nC.Two at Hongkong.\nIn short\nI know that\nthe M.\nD.\nwould much prefer\nto\ndeal with Mr. Bond\nand his only\nreason for wanting me back is that he must have been told to\ndo whatever neces-\nsary to close the\nbreach that existed between us.\nI em perfectly willing to go to Nanking provided you give me\nority to make the best deal I\ncan make in the interests of the Company.\nauth-\nYou\nwould of course wish to establish a minimum which you are prepared to accept\nand I would\nattempt to\nget as much above that minimum as possible.\nHowever\nit will be impossible\nclear details from Nanking as\ncommunications from\nthere are extremely difficult.\nI would expect to either close a satisfactory\ndeal\nOr\nleave Nanking within a period of one week and would\nannounce such in-\ntention at\nthe opening of negotiations.\nVery truly yours,\nPAN AMERICAN AIRWAYS COMPANY\n1m\nH. M.\nBixby\nHMB : MF\nVice-President for China\nP. S.\nem job at Nanking is goung to br virt\ndifficult an\nis not made easier by the fact\nthat er must Eliminate Gaa from\nthe equation.\nf CNAC.
