    "media:imagetext": "October 15, 1937\nDM 27/\nPERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL\nMr. Harold M. Bixby\nVice President for China\nPan American Airways Co.\nManila, Philippine Isls.\nDear Mr. Bixby:\nYour personal and confidential letter of October 7th\narrived on the same day with your cable $148 outlining your suggestions\nfor a resumption of cooperation with CNAC. As you will have observed\nve answered with commendable promptness approving your plans.\nYou will\nprobably be in Nanking by the time this letter reaches the Far East,\nand so it is hardly calculated to be helpful but, as nothing is pre-\ndictable in our business, I an sending it along to give you a little\nbackground on our feeling here which may possibly come in useful.\nFrankly I think you described your program perfectly\nwhen you called it a forlorn hope and referred to it as visionary.\ncan hardly\nbelieve for a moment that it will work out in actual\ntice,\nFor it teems fore that the see reasons militate einst\nit that forced us to drop out of the picture two months ago.\nHowever,\nyou must have some good reason for feeling that the situation is more\nhopeful nos.\nOf course, if we can hold our position by sone tenuous\ntie-up with our Chinese\nfriends it may be helpful when the day of set-\ntlement arrives, but I recall your saying sometime ago that any effort\nto cooperate or\nconditions\nparticipate in the operations of CNAC under present\nnight simply result in our being declared \"in\" when the\nfinal probable debacle cones, making it even more difficult for us to\ntry to revert to a settlement on the basis of the status quo of August\nthirteenth.\nIt seems to me\nthat in the end our settlement is very\nlikely to be arranged through some form of diplomatic claim, and I\ndoubt whether our chances there would be notably improved by our re-\nentry\nthe picture at this time.\nHowever,\nthe President feels that\nfrom the lashington angle it would be a very good thing if we could con-\ntinue to hold some sort of a position in China.\nHe also had in mind the possibility that we might work\nout some further financing from the\nImport and Export Bank.\nThis was\na new angle to me and apparently his thoughts in this line are based\non some very informal conversations\nhe had in Washington. Nevertheless",
