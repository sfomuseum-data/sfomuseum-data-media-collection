    "media:imagetext": "Bixby, Manila\n- 2 -\nOctober 15, 1937\nit is something to be considered.\nIt is on this basis, although frankly\nwe are both very skeptical (and I, characteristically, more so\nthan he)\nthat he approved your undertaking.\nI am much relieved to note from your letter that you feel\nthere is very slight personal danger involved in your going to Manking,\nand I hope you are not unduly optimistic.\nI don't think the chances of\nsuccess are such as to warrant either you or Bond running any risks\nwhatever,\nsure, in spite of what you say, that there must be\na considerable risk. I shall feel much relieved when I hear you have\ncome out again.\nYou refer in your letter to the fact that CNAC needs\ndirection, spare parts,\nnew equipment, and new motors.\nWith regard to\nthe first item I an a bit non-plussed as to what you are going to find\nleft to direct.\nIt is true there are\ntwo DC-2*s, and possibly\nanother if we can send over the new fuselage from the\nDouglas factory,\nthat you are going to have to operste with three American pilots--and\nthe nost recent acquisitions of CNAC and evidently,\nfrom their\nwillingness to continue operating through the recent disturbances, very\nmuch of the \"barnstorming\"\ntype.\nIn other words, the best and most re-\nliable pilots have gone out of the picture for good.\nYou also say\nthat\nour prize Chinese pilot, Donald kong, has quit and the othere are definite-\nly not up to DC-2 operations.\nIf you have Wilke and Larsen available,\nmaintenance may improve but I wonder if they have adequate facilities at\nthe bases where they will need to operate, and they certainly must be in\nneed of spare\nparts, etc.\nThis brings me to the second question, which is,\nwe going to get new spare\nparts, new motors,\nand other new equipnent which\nCNAC may buy,\npresumably with funds advanced by the Government, into China?\nIt begins to look now as though neutrality legislation would not be in-\nvoked, and so we can probably\ncontinue to make shipments without any legal\ndifficulties,\nbut the physical difficulties are going to be enormous.\ndo not see the possibility of shipping into Shanghai\nfor a long time\ncome and I understand that boate which have to stop at Japanese ports,\nand others as well, are refusing shipments which can be classed as muni-\ntions, even if consigned to Hong Kong.\nPasco is quite willing\nbut I think one of the first problems for you and Bond to settle will\nto advise us of the nethod by which we can make or at least try\nshipment of spare parts for CNAC, not only with assurance of delivery\nbut with assurance that we will be paid.\nThe President was quite upset when he realized that the\nDC-2 had been flown away from Hong Kong after settling the Texas 011 clan\nbut without paying us anything.\nUnfortunately I had assured him that we\nwere going to hold that plane until we atleast got the $100,000 Mexican\nwith balance promised, which program he reluctantly approved. I see you\ndAEOLISIPIO",
