    "media:imagetext": "Mr. Bixby\nOctober 15, 1937\nhave Col. Lun's\nword for it that Pan American will be made a payment\nas soon as the plane reaches Hankow, and I hope your faith will be\njustified.\nI also hope that the\nsale of the Connodores will go through\nwithout any further hitch and will be satisfactorily handled at Hong\nKong in your\nabsence.\nTo close with a light touch,\nif there can be such a\nthing in such a serious situation, I was much intrigued at your state-\nment\nthat it is plamed to operate a service from Chungking to Hong\nKong with a DC-2 vie Knelyang\nand #a point in Kwangsi Province\", You\ncan imagine what Mr. Priester's feelings would be towards\nsuch a care-\nfully prepared\noperation as this!\nFortunately he does not consider\nthese operations now to be under his supervision, as I would certainly\nnever\ndate to ley this suggestion before him.\nI find on the map there\nare a lot of\ntowns in Kwangei,\nand. I assume\nany. of them will do for the\npurpose you weil have in mind!\nI an a bit at a loss to know how you\nare going to get gasoline and other supplies in there, as well as to\nKweiyang,\nand the thought of inaugurating this operation over this un-\nsurveyed\nroute with Messrs.\nSweet, Smith, and another whose nane you\ndo not\neven\nknow;\ntogether with the prospect of coming into Canton\n(which I understand is periodically\nunder attack by the Japanese air\nforce)\nfills me with apprehension.\nFurthermore, as this is a round-\nabout route with Eurasia holding the advantage of the shorter line Canton-\nHankow, I wonder if you really think the operation would be worth the\nrisks and difficulties involved. I doubt if we would get much, if any,\ninternational airmail over that route, in which case it would only be\nof doubtful political value so far as\nthe Washington picture is con-\ncerned.\nReferring above to the Japanese brings up another\nthought\nwhich Ian sure you have not lost sight of, which is the very doubtful\nvalue of any assurances or guarantees you may obtain from the Japanese\nmilitary.\nThe papers only yesterday reported the machine-gunning of\nthree officiel automobiles which had the British flag painted on their\nroofs.\nIt is true\nthat they were travelling fairly near the scene of\nactive operations, but of course the Japanese aircraft must cruise\nfairly widely.\nI am wondering, just how much faith you can put in the\ngreen color with which you plan to baptize the CNAC planes.\ncall that in one of your earlier letters you put the danger to our\nplanes as being from the Chinese and Japanese militaries in that order:\nIn concluding this rather gloomy letter,\nwhich I hope\nw111 not arrive until\neverything has been worked out right, let me say\nin all\nsincerity that I admire very\nmuch your even trying to go ahead\non these plans, and the desperate efforts you are making to work out\nsomething to protect the conpany's interests.\nI only hope that you will\nnot let your anxiety to achieve the impossible lead you too far.",
