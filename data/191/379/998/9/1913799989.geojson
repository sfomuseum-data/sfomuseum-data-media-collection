    "media:imagetext": "Flying from Hongkong to Hankow\nOct.25, 1937.\nDear Family:\nAm now on a trip which\npromises to be a very interesting one and\nso for my own amusement and to continue my long neglected family letters\n\"I'll write as I please.\"\nMr. Bond and I left Hongkong at 11:55 this morning•\nWe are flying\nin a tri-motored Junkers operated by the Sino-German Eurasia Company.\nOn the 15-passenger plane with us is one Chinése gentleman,\ntwo foreign\nmen and two women,\nalso a full load of air express including 175 lbs. of\nanti-toxin consigned to the American Ambassador at Nanking•\nThe latter\nshipment came\nover from the U.S. by Pan American and 1s\ncarried free of\ncharge by all airlines concerned.\nIt is somewhat gratifying to one in\nbusiness - temporarily resident in China - to\nsee aircraft put to\ngood constructive use after viewing and reading about all the destructive\nand cruel uses to which airplanes have lately been put in China.\nOur take-off was bumpy as are most take-offs from the pocket-like\nHongkong airport surrounded by high mountains.\nClimbed through low\nground haze and broken white fluffy clouds at 3000 feet and now, having\ncrossed infamous Bias Bay (where the Chinese pirates have given way to\nthe more legal but equally piratical Japs),\nwe are flying over Chinese\nDown below are rugged brown mountains completely deforested\nsides seared and torn by the\nrush of mad streams born of the torrential\nrains which come in the typhoon season.\nIn the valleys small Chinese\nvillages furnish shelter for the coolie farmers who cultivate every inch\nof soil washed down from the mountains.\nThe little valleys look very\npeaceful and viewing\ncan understand why many of our Chinese\nfriends have sent\ntheir femilies \"back to the country\".\nThose little\nvillages are\nnot worth a Japanese serial bomb - no army occupation of\ncountry\nthreatened and those little villages are probably\nbefore because the war lords are all busy and\ntheir hordes\nof Chinese soldiers through this section.\naway from the coast now flying at 7000 feet - clouds\ndisappeared and an Arizona sky stretches from one haze covered\nhorizon\nother.\nWe have not sighted any\nother airplanes and I'll\nbe perfectly happy\nif none are encountered - of either side !\nthat the Hankow Field - our objective - was bombed\nnight before\nlast by\nJapanese planes - hangar destroyed\n- three Chinese\nbombers on the ground and our poor old Western Division of PAA Ford\n\"loaned\" to the Chinese Army were all burned up.\nUnfortunately,\nbombers were a German made Heinkle, an Italian made Savola-Machetti (sp !)\nand an American made Martin,\nall badly needed by the Chinese, and among\nthe last of the good planes\nthey had left.\nThe pilot also says the\nfield is full of shell holes but all holes are clearly marked with red\nflags and several runways are marked\nout for safe landing areas so there\nis nothing to worry about.\nBond reminds me that it is now 1:30\nand that\nour Chinese No.l at Hongkong sent some\nlunch boxes to us, so we'll have\nchow and I'll\ncontinue this letter later on.\nLater - in fact after a good lunch of fried chicken,\nsandwiches,\nhot coffee and\ncake,\na smoke and took a\nshort siesta.\n07e carette, *lated con\nchair back, enjoyed\ncontained some\ncold\nsalad\nbut I passed that up.\nThere is still some cholera in Hongkong) •\nIt is\nnow 2:30 PM and\nare now about 375 miles northwest of Hongkong\n-1-",
