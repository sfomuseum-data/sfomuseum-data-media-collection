Yesterday was also a bad day - therefore a good\nday.\nOur Meneging Director arrived from Henkow having been unable to join us\nFriday because\nthe airplane schedule was cancelled that day account weather.\nVie\nhad a session with him - went to dinner at the International Club where most of the\nforeigners remaining in Nanking congregate every Saturday night to make a little\nwhoopie up to curfew time at 11 P.M.\nI met many old friends there and had a fine\ntime.\nThere was only one woman present - a French girl who arrived here a few\nweeks ago as a volunteer nurse -\nfell in love with a French newspaper o respondes\nand was married night before last.\nThe whole town turned out for the wedding.\nWomen in Nanking are so scarce that whenever\nyou see\none you stemp your hand as\nthe kids do when they see a white horse.\nAbout 80% of the foreign population of\nNanking has\nOne.\nI had a long talk with Mr. Holm a good friend of ours who used to be Posta\nCommissioner at Chungking.\nHe has resigned and is keen on returning with Mrs.\nto his \"home\"\nin Copenhagen after thirty years in China.\nI wonder if they won't\nsoon went to\ncome back.\nâ‚¬ to cood baa beluter cinese coet proved rent free vy the post\nfor instance, at Chungking Mr. Holm was a real per-\nOffice, surrounded by\na lovely garden.\nHe travelled to work in a grand\nfitted out like a small\nthrone, borne by bur uniformed chair coolies.\nNo. l boy who ran the house and looked after every detail from food to\npressing\nshining his shoes.\nSeveral coolies were at his beck and call to run\nThree gardners\ncared for his\nthough it were\nLater - Sunday night - rain and low ceiling all day.\nHad long conference\nwith Vice-Minister of Communications which lasted all morning and accomplished\nnothing.\nVery\ndiscouraging,\nLunch with lir. Pook and Mr. Johnson also d inner -\nmuch conversation but no results.\nAmericen attitude very sympathetic and helpfu?\nChinese very unsympathetic and non cooperative.\nsome Chinese officials can be\nunbelievably dull and stupid. Our friend of today's onference seems intent only\non immediate necessities\nto\nthe exclusion of all else. Hope for better luck to-\nmorrow.\nWe have been here now two and one half days with no air attack which probably\nmeans a strong one or more tomorrow, unless of course this weather continues.\nis an air of expectancy in lanking, a sort of indefinite\ntenseness which must get\non everyones' nerves sooner or later.\nPossibly they get used to it and probably\nI would too but frenkly I'll be glad to get away.\nWill send this letter by Tuesdey's plane to Hankow with the hope that it\nwill catch Eurasia to Hongkong Wednesdey and the Clipper to Manila on Thursday.\nNext installment will B llow later.\nWe\nget little news here except about the Shanghai front end even that is\nmixed with all sorts of wild rumors.\nWeren't the Japs showing their real nature\nwhen they fired at the \"doomed battled on\"\nwhen they evacueted that warehouse and\nsurrendered\nto the British for internment?\nThose dirty little Japs haven't any\ndecent traits.\nWhy didn't they cease firing and give those Chinese\na rousing cheer\nwhen they evacuated. That would have been sporting - but not at all Japanose.\nAs ever\nHarold\ndavaristpios",
