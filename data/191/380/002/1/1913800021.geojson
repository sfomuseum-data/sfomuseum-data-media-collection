The weather was\nperfect when we came except for a few snow storms. The trip down\nthe Columbia River Canyon was beautiful or rather it was grand.\nGreat snow covered mountains towering above us on either side\nwith the water down below boiling and\nchurning over the rocks\nand down the rapids. The sun was setting right in front\nof us\nbehind a mountain of clouds rising thousands of feet into the\nsky. Later as we got down toward where the River broadens out\nto a mile or more the sun had gone down and the lightd of Van-\ncouver, Washington showed on our left. Farbher on to the right\nother little\ntown lights twinkled and then as we passed over\nthe river and headed slightly Southwest we\ncould see the red\nNeon sign of the Richfield Oil Co. It is on top of a tall off-\nice building\nPortland and\neach letter\nof RICHFIELD is sixty\nfeet high,\nThen\nthe thousands\nof lights\nof the city,\nswift\nride\nover\nthe\noutskirts and\nwe\ncircled\nthe Airport\nwhich is\nlocated\non an\nisland in\nbay\nor harbor.\nThe\nflood lights of\nthe field came\non and\nwe\nglide d down\nto a perfect landing.\nThe trimotor\nfrom\nCalifornia\nwhich was\nsupposed to\ncarry me\non for another hour and\na half flight to Seattle was\nforced\ndown by bad visibility in California -\nbelieve it\nor not-\nand they\nadvised me\nat\nthe Airport\nthat\nif I wanted\nto\nget\nto\nSeattle\nit would be well to take the train as the prediction for\ntoday\nwaS\nvery\nbad,\nArrived\nhere thes morning and\nfound Groeger\ntraveling companion, waiting for\nme.\nHe\n,by the way,\nmy\nwears very\nwell and\nsee: ms to know the technical\nside\nof airtransport\nfrom\nA to Z.\nAs I told you before leaving I will typewrite\nsome of\nmy letters to you making copies which I will send\nto Frances and\nBo and to the family. This is the first of that series and\nin\nspite\nof the\nseek\nand peck system\nof typing I think the net\nsult\nconsiderable\nsaving of\ntime. I hope none\nof those\nthe receiving end will\nfeel slighted.\nI really have a lot\nof\nletters\nto write and a lot of paper work to do.\nMy love to you and Cat and Hebe,\nsto g\nust a wirk\nNad\nnow darlin\nsener ur sa\nдаль\nand Im\nfor the brat freig\nbeur but hels\nit.\nsurr\nand One or happy if you\ntoo\nvie try to be happy - dee my lor to gorta",
