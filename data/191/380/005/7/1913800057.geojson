    "media:imagetext": "January 30, 1933.\nDear\nDebby\nThis aeries two of my shot gun correspondence being broadcast\nfrom somewhere on the storm tossed so called Pacific Ocean.\nWe sailed from\nVictoria at five thirty Saturday afternoon, and after passing through the\nstraits headed out across the Pacifio. We immediately ran into what the Cap-\ntain calls \" a bit of nasty weather \" which has put most of t he few passengers\nin their respective staterooms. Saturday night there were only three men\nwho\nshowed un for dinner besides Groeger and meself.\nCroever is an old sailing\nship captain so the thick weather bothers him not at all. So far it has not\neffected me and I am hoping that I will turn out to be a good sailor - I have\nreelly never been in rough weather before as my very limited experience has\nall been in fair weather.\nThe ship is rolling and plunging so that it is ex-\nremely hara to get around. Outside the oold spray is flying the whole length\nof the ship and the rigging is ice covered. There are no games\non deck and\nno steamer chairs. The few passengers who\nventure out of their rooms sit\naround the open fires in the \"tap roon\" and work on their scotch and Soda\".\nTesterday, Sunday, Groeger and I called on the Captain and made arrangements\nfor Groeger to have access\nto the bridge and chart room so that he can make\nthe weather obversations which he was instructed to secure. The Captain is an\nEnglishmen who has sailed all over the World during his thirty years at sea,\nand he seems to enjoy swapping yarns with Groeger and giving information on\nflying conditions. He is very much ammused at the idea of ever flying across\nthe Pacific and of course knows nothing whatever about airtrensportation or\nits Limitacions â€¢\nLast night we had a Movie, Careless Age, featuring Douglas\nTiphonke and Loreta Young. It was an old \"talkie\" with no talking. The\ngirLs\nwore dresses which came just to the knees and looked awfully funny. After each\nreel a sim came on \"ONE MOMENT PLEASE\" and the Chink who was the operator\nwould put on the next reel. All the crew except the officers are Chinese and\nnone of them can underatand English. My stateroom steward looks like a Guinea\nPig and so I call him \"G P\". He gives me a lot of service as he has no one else\nto look after. This morning Groeger and I took \"shots\" for Typhoid and Friday",
