    "media:imagetext": "we are going to be vacinated. Groeger was very much worried about the \"shots\" and\nwould have backed out t his norning if I hadn't dug him out of his room and drag-\ned him down to the ship\ndoctor telling him that I had promised Mr. Trippe that I\nwould see to it that we both were vaginated, etc.\nYou may have noticed some improvement in my typewriting, but whether\nyou have or not, I an very glad to have the machine along because it would be\nvery diffioult to write long hand with the boat rolling the way it is. They say\nthis weather will last all the way over. You see we follow the great circle\ncourse which takes us for north,in fact we will be within sight (with reasonably\ngood visability) of the Alutian Islands for two or three days.\nGroeger and I sit at a table with the Chief Executive Officer who is\nsecond in commend and whose duties on board ship correspond to those of a general\nmanager in busines concerns. He has been so busy that we have seen him only once\nthe rest of the time he has been what the Chinese stewerd who serves our table\ncalls \"top side\" which I assune means in Ni dwest landlubber langusge *up staires\nHis name is Claxton and he looks like an English character on the Comic Opera\nstage, but ho is very agreable and I imagine rather nioe if you could evor get\nunder his convervat ive skin. While I am writing t his we are ploughing through\nthe biggest waves I've ever seen, and just to add to the fun also a snow storm\nof blizzard proportions. Its nice and warm in my stateroom. Groeger has just come\nin to tell me that he feels sort of sick fron his innouculation,\nbut I guess its\nnot very serious for his next corment was\n\"When do we eat\" an indoor pastime at\nwhich I have found him moat proficient. The food is very good and the menu like\nmoot ship menus includes every thing from soup to nuts. Groeger has not take n\nmany finesses to date. He is very good company and tells some amusing stories\nabout his experiences on sailing vessels, in flying operations at Havena and in\nBrazil where he has been in charge for Pan American. He has promised to get me\na Honey Bear for Bo. Or maybe we had better give the Honey Be ar to Ralph as\nGroeger says it is Impossible to \"housebreak* them.\nHe said that he had one for\na year in which time he trained him to get his slippers and do a lot of tricke\nbut he was not able to teach him not\nto do certain tricks and had to ultimately\nmake a choice between Irs.Groeger or the Honey Bear. So the H.B. got the air.\nMust stop now for Lunch. Personal message follows, and I'll write\nsova aain. Hop you kids on back, our ha\nand skat\nhappen pose cong fore this reaches you.\nLots of cour\nDadas",
