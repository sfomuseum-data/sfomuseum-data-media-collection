    "media:imagetext": "we are going to be vacinated. Groeger was very much worried about the \"shots\" and\nwould have backed out t his morning if I hadn't dug him out of his room and drag-\ned him down to\nthe ship doctor telling him that I had promised Mr. Trippe that I\nwould see to it that we both were vacinated, etc.\nYou may have noticed some improvement in my typewriting, but whether\nyou have or not, I am very glad to have the machine along because it would be\nvery difficult to write long hand with the boat rolling the way it is. They say\nthis weather will last all the way over. You see we follow the great circle\ncourse which takes us far north, in fact we will be within sight (with reasonably\ngood visability) of the Alutian Islands for two or three days.\nGroeger and I sit at a table with the Chief Executive Officer who is\nsecond in command and whose duties on board ship correspond to those of a general\nmanager in busines concerns. He has been so busy that we have seen him only once\nthe rest of the time he has been what the Chinese steward who serves our table\ncalls \"top side\" which I assume means in Mi dwest landlubber language \"up stairs!\nHis name is Claxton and he looks like an English character on the Comic Opera\nstage, but he is very agreable and I\nimagine rather nice if you could ever get\nunder his conservat ive skin. While I am writing t his we are ploughing through\nthe biggest waves I've ever seen, and just to add to the fun also a snow storm\nof blizzard proportions. Its nice and warm in my stateroom. Groeger has just come\nin to tell me that he feels sort of sick from his innouculation, but I guess its\nnot very serious for his next comment was \"When do we eat\" an indoor pastime at\nwhich I have found him moat proficient. The food is very good and the menu like\nmost ship menus includes every thing from soup to nuts. Groeger has not take n\nmany finesses to\ndate. He is very good company and tells some amusing stories\nabout his experiences on sailing vessels, in flying operations at Havana and in\nBrazil where he has been in charge for Pan American. He has promised to get me\na Honey Bear for Bo. Or maybe we had better give the Honey Be ar to Ralph as\nGroeger says it is Impossible to \"housebreak\" them. He said that he had one for\na year in which time he trained him to get his slippers and do a lot of tricks\nbut he was not able to teach him not\nto do certain tricks and had to ultimately\nmake a choice between Mrs. Groeger or the Honey Bear. So the H.B. got the air.\nMust stop now for Lunch. Personal message follows, and I'll write\nagain toon.\nDibby dearnt a fre aufully alone\nout herr - it some corefort to with this to you\nfor I know that later on o wont ful quite\nso lonesome, and then\nright.\nyour\nown - trad\n5120. 13",
