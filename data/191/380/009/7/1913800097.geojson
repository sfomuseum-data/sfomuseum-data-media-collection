They are owned by the\nUnited States and judring by what we saw of them today no other nation is ver\nlikely to try to take them away from us. Great snow covered rocks rise out of\nthe Pacific apparently almost\nstraight up,\nand from what t he various ship off-\nicers say, entirely uninhabited. They were beautiful in the sunshine of this\n- some of the highest I would guess rising 1500 feet above the sea.\nWe ran within twenty or thirty miles of t hem.\nTonight we cross the 180th meridian, and so tomorrow will be Saturday,\ninstead of Friday. The weather has been very much better since Monday\nnight,\nand the crew all say that this has been to\ndate a very smooth crossing for this\ntime of the year. It is very cold out and just now especially as the wind is\nfrom the Northwest,\nblowing at a velosity of forty miles an hour, and coming\nfrom across Siberta which as I guess you know is not a rival of Miami for the\nwinter season.\nGroger and I had a Chinese dinner Monday ni ght, chop sticks and all.\nWe started with \"bird's nest\"\nsoup, then dried duck which was terrible,\na lot of side dishes which were suppose a to be great de licasies, followed\nby a fish which was really quite good. It was worth the price of admission to\nsee Groeger worry with the Chinese steward about what every thing was before\nhe would eat it.\nAll the time I knew that he would have given a lot for some\nnice \"pigs knuckles and kraut\" but the poor fellow went the route like a good\nsport. Today I asked him if he wanted another Chinese dinner tonight and he\njust looked sort of pale and said he'd be willing to wait until we got to\nChina where we might not be able to ge t anything else.\nI played deck tennis today in the middle of a snow storm. It was the\nfirst exercise I have had on board.\nnere are Three or Tour uncisnner ou\nboard all destined for Oriental points to represent house s back \"home\" as\nthey call it, although some of them have spent most of their lives in China\ndeck tennis and it was a\nsat around a\ntable in the taproo m\nfun listening to them talk of their experiences over a round\nthree couples\non bos ra\nwhen 1s a cew dov\nbride.
