Everything on the ship is tied down and walking is difficult,\nunles you have something to hold onto.\nThey say that we may possibly get in\nto Yokohama on Wednesday night instead of Thursday morning as scheduled. My\npresent plans are to spend a day or two at Tokyo and then catch this same\nboat at Kobe, going on to Shanghai, Hong Kong and Manila.\nTonight we are to have some more non-talking \"Talkies\" in\nthe shape of \"The Girl from Woolworths.\" We also are engaged in a pingpong\nchampionship which\nGroeger and I have both gone into. I have promised him\na gold watch and chain if he wins the tournament. Am reasonably safe because\nI can beat him and practically anyone else on the boat can beat me, so his\nchances are wht you might say somewhat remote.\nI have learned to know most of the other passengers by name\nnow. There is a Mr. and Mrs. Burke who live in the Philippines and have just\nbeen home to Washington for Christmas. They are very nice but not particularly\ninteresting.\nThere is an Englishmen who represents the Shell Petroleum Co., in\nJapan, another who sells machinery for a wholesale firm in Manchester, another\nwho represents the Goodrich Tire, also an American with the Standard Oil Co\nat Hong Kong. An Englishman who has lived in Singapore and who I think is a\n\"barister\". One interesting man is the head of an arbacological society at\nSingapore. He has lived so long among the Chinese and the Indians that he sits\nin a chair with his feet under him, and I suppose would really be more com-\nfortable if he could sit on the floor. We call him Ghandi, and he has no small\nlikness for Ghandi except that he is a few shades whiter and its too darned\ncold to get along withba sheet if that is his habit.\nThis is an ampuls, stupid littre. The truth\nis that ther is nothing\nreace, gous on. cor neir\nsue anything on do anything out\naroun\nand kill time.\ning but just ad t\nglad to\nat Shanghai for any\na founder may come along for 7 ear\nLolo an",
