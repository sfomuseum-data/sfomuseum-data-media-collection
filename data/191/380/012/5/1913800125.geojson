Groeger\nand I went ashore as soon as we could get through with the usual procedure of rules\nand regulations. We walked around town until late in the afternoon when practically\nexhausted with all that exercise we came back on board to get a bath and have dinner\nwith the idea of starting out after dinner with a crowd of other passengers. Instead\nof doing so we all sat around postponing the date of starting until it got so late\nthat someone suggested that which all of us had been thinking about - le going to\nbed. Groeger and I had to\nget an early start for Yokohama in the\nmorning • We arr-\nived at Tokyo about nine oclock and went immediately to see the officials of the\nJapan Air Transport. They were a little cool at first but we finally got better ac-\nquainted. They asked us to lunch and gave us our choice of an English or a Japanese\nFood howeve with him is a rather sacred institution which like marriage\nshould not \"be entered into lightly but advisedly etc.\" Well anyway we went around\nin the morning to see a temple and look at t he\nmansion or the\nEmpreror doing\nJusT\nenough walking to get up a goodampetite for lunch. We were taken to the Maple Club,\nwhere we were told Col. and Mrs. Lindbergh had been entertained, also Charlie Chaplin\nand other celebrities. We took off our\nsnoes at the Iron door •a periormance willen\nis O.K. except for that awful moment when you are not sure whether your socks have a\n\"leak\" in the m or not. We sat on the floor in Ghandi fashion, a small lacquer table\nin front of eachone of us, and on the other side a Geisha girl to serve us. The late\nter could not help laughing at Groeger and me as we tried to eat with our chopsticks\nand especially at Groeger who was the most uncomfortable looking man you ever saw.\nthe Japs all make as\nmuch noise with their soup as possible - a sign with them of\ngreat appreciation. I started sucking soup as vociferously as the rest and that was\ntoo much for poor Groeger. He gave me one agonizing look and then exploded blowing\nhis soup out as hard as the rest had been sucking theirs in. We had saki, raw fish,\nrice, bamboo salad and all the other standard delicasies - all of which Groeger ate\nwith apparent lack of enjoymenta After lunch we drove out to the Airport which is\nabout the same distance from town as most Amerivan ports. It is a very good one and\nwill be much better when completed.\nWe left Tokyo at nine fifteen that night by sleeper for Kobe where we had\nhad hot been able to reserve space, and the only\nthing laft was an\neach in sevarave compar unenus.\nThe man who had the\nterence howaro caras and\n\"hocker\".\nand with the frequent and somewhat rough stops\nkept me awake a good\nWe got to Kobe in time to catch the boat and\ntoday have had a beautiful\nmoron the\ndown to Nagasaki, Here we are\nthe night while the ship\nThe latter operation would de-\nBarges of coal are brought along side, ladders\nảtrung up\nothe coat nores\nof men and women pass small baskets\n…roll one\nto another. This ship holds the Worlds\nand the record\nwas made here at Nagasaki. The Japs swarm over the barges like\nsteady\nflow of coal goes into the ship - something like three thousand tons in six hours.\nTomorrow morning we are going ashore for a little while to look around,\nand then at ten oclock we sail for Shanghai. Must stop now and get some sleep as it\nis quite late and I can hear the man in the stateroom next door getting restless.\nSunday am.
