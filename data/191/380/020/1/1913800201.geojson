    "media:imagetext": "SHANGHAI\nFEB. 23, 1933\nDearest Debs.\nYou have the weather to thank, or blame, for this letter. I\nstarted to go\nout to see the movie Grand Hotel which I hav e always missed at St.\nLouis,\nNew York\nBolton and other American metropolitan centers,\nbut when I got ready to call one of\nthe many Richsha boys the rain was coming down in torrents,\nso decided to stay\nin\nmy room,\nMy night boy was much relieved when I came back - he tried to tell me that\nthe rain was coming down in bucket fulls be fore I went out - but all I\ncould\nmake\nout of his conversation was \"Master no go, velly bad lain, catchy cold\". Didn't make\nup my mind as to what he had said until later - his talk was not as plain as it looks\nin print. He is always most solicitous about me and gives me\nsuch service as you\nhave never known.\nThe Hotel requests that tips be within reason and\nsuggests about\nfive cents,\ngood\neducating to get\nare about fifty - and I guess they are afraid some of the\n\"boys\"\nwill retire if the guests get liberal. Everyother word\nwith them is \"Catchy\".\n\"Shall Master\ncatchy bath, or catchy bleakfast, catchy laundry, etc.\" They never get\nan \"r\". You get so used to saying \"nore big\"\nand \"more high\"\nand such\n\"Pigeon\" talk\nthat its very hard to keep those expressions out of your ordinary conversation with\nother people not Chinese.\nIt is quite easy to get around whereever you want to\ngo without knowing\nany Chinese.\nAlmost all of them here in Shanghai\nspeak some English,\nat least enough\nto direct you.\nHave given up all idea, if I\never had any, of trying to learn their\nlanguage. The written characters are the same all over China,\nbut the spoken words\nare entirely different in sound. For instance the numeral\nin Canton, and \"Sen\"\nin Shanghai. Two is \"Liang\"\nSo a man from Canton might as well be in Germany as here, so far as making himself\nunderstood is concerned, unless he knows how to write. This is one reason for their\nlack of unity, but a more important factor is the fact that a mans family come first\nfollowed by his city, then by his province and last the nation. One of the men I\nhave met here told me of having dined with a Chinese woman the night before. She had\nbeen educated abroad and spoke English perfectly. During the course of the dinner\nhe asked her where she was from in China and she told him the name of a small town\nin one of the Southern provinces. He remarked that she did not use the dialect of\nthat district, and she exclaimed\n\"Oh my family left there two hundred\nyears ago. He\nadmitted that was an extreme case because she was very proud of her ancestry, but\nsaid that he had run across innumerable cases where the man or woman had never seen\ntheir\"home\"\nas they called it.\nThe Chinese who leave for other countries seem to\ndevelop a rather keen love for the \"Fatherland\"\nbut that is not true of\nthose who\nstay home. This fact has misled a lot of\npeople in the United States and elsewhere\nto expect a lot more National cooperation in the Jehol area than will probably be\nforthcoming.\nI do hope there may be some way out of that threatened calamity. Wrote\nto Walter Weisenburger yesterday and told him that he probably knew more about what\nwas going on over here through the St. Louis Press than I do - unless he says \"Star\"\ninstead of \"Paper\",\nThe\nfield for Aviation is apparently\nalmost unlimited because of the lack\nof transportation facilities between large centers of\npopulation. Most travel is by\nwater,\nthe service is infrequent, extremely slow and schedules poorly maintained.\nThere\nis a tremendous interest in Airtransport but they seem to know very little\nabout flying boats, which it seems to me are much more practicable for operation\nover here than land equipment. All the large cities are on or near water, airports\nare hard to secure, and the whole life and habit of the people is, and has been for\ncenturies, controlled by availability of vator transportation.
