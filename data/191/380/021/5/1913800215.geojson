He is a young man of about thirty three\nyears of age. He runs a garage to eat and sells, or tries to sell, air planes\n102et 04.\nagent under Gale and Company of this city, who are the recognized outlet\nUnited Aviation products in China. He also represents Fleet of Buffalo, and\nclaims to have sold about thirty training planes to the hinese Government at\nNanking.\nThese are the planes being used\nby the American Aviation Mission at\nHangchow for the purpose of training Chinese Pilots. Nahunacher has another\nyoung fellow with him by the name of Lewis who is also a pilot. There is no\nrecognized civil aviation in China, no licenses are iasued for commercial or\nprivate flying. Apparently both Nahmmacher and Lewis have done a good deal. of\nbarnstorming work by air all with a view of selling military, rather than\nprivate, aircraft. He does not think there is any mrket over here for\na good line of conversation - plenty of it - has lived over here long enough\nto know his way around, and is reported financially responsible within sone-\nwhat restricted bounds.\nMen who have lived over here for forty years frankly admit that they\ndo not know a bit more than when they came here, so you cant expect much from\na man who has been here two weelts.\nThere are a number of things with respect\nhowever,\nwhich I am willing to write about. First, as I said be-\nfore there is no civil aviation. Landing fields are a long way apart, and you\nwould not have that picture of two crashes and a question mark hanging on the\nwall if the crackups had been over here. Your widow might have the first one.\nAlmost every inch of ground is taken up with rice fields - the Chinese pro-\nnounce \"rice\" \"lice\" and well they might when it somes to a forced landing,\nwith a ditch well dyked with a wall of\nnousana years or bo.\nThen where ever\none year.
