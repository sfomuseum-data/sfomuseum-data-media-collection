    "media:imagetext": "CATHAY HOTEL\nSHANGHAI\nMARCH 2, 1933\nDear Family;\nThis is my first letter to Dauphin's Island, and I hope that in due course\nof time it will reach you there.\nThere has been no mail from home since Feb. 22 nd\nso of course I donot know whether you are going to be South or not.\nYou can tell the Bacons that the Canadian Pacific Steamship Co. is now\nserving \"Shrimp a la Seafort Inn\" when ever the Empress of Asia can get any real\nfresh shrimp.\nWe had some awfully good shrimp\nwhen we gou to Japan, so 1 asked th\nDining Room steward if he could have some cooked the way we had them at Dauphin\nIsland. Groeger and I had them\nthat way,\ntold some of the other\npassengers, and\nas a result this dish became very popular.\nThe steward told me they would\ncontinue\nto serve the shrimps that way and\nwould call the style as I have written it above.\nI am still\nwaiting for certain developments in New York before going ahead\nwith negotiations here. In the mean time there is plenty to be done in the way of\ngathering all sortd of information regarding the principal cities to be served in\ncase operations are begun, what the facilities are for landing,\ntype and kind of\nsurface competition, train and boat schedules, accommodations,\ntime\nin transit,\namount of first class passengers and first class mail moving between certain\npolnus,\neuc, euc.\nGroeger 1s\ncourse helping on all this, and has just returned\nfrom a trip to Peiping (Peking) which he made by boat going\nand by air coming b\nback so that he could study the water service, harbor facilities, etc. He says\nthat Peiping is very interesting now with all the excitement.\nHe met Marshall\nChangs pilot who is an old barnstorming flier who used to be in some of Bill Rob-\nertson's air shows at Lambert Field. His name is Perry Hutton. The character of\nthe old man in The Good Earth is supposed to be the father of Chang,\nand\nthe lat-\nter is Sons. Hutton, another American pilot and two American mechanics are living\nthe best hotel in Peiping with fat salaries and all expenses paid. Groeger\nsaid they were a very clean wholesome lot of typical American boys who are reap-\ning a harvest out of the necessities of Chang's military \"face\".\nThey do not have\nmuch flying to do, and so with the help of a legion of Chineses coolies they keep\nthe Ford Irimotors looking as though they had just come from the factory.\nLast night Col.Jouett called me up and asked me to join a party he\nwas giving at the Jai Ali.\nThe Chinese have gone crazy over that game, and they\nhave some of the best of the Spanish,\nmexican and Cuban players come over here.\nCol. Jouett's mother,\nMrs.J and Mrs. Christy Matthison were on the party.\nThe\nWest Point\nknew old\none of the\nin the old\nsure urdu\nthat now\nMrs. Jouett\nnanaea you one\nThey\ngot them\nOf N.A.\nthe players\never void\nFeb.4th\nana also one Irom each o\nletters - the first\nto have those\nbecause une\nwere unexnecteo.\nit must have\ncome in ahead of\nlove to you - no copies of this to anyone else.\nKnow\nyou are all haviny a\n. grand time.\nHon сотри\nfound\non treaux its certaine,\nthe kind of place the\nworll\near and that wore's cor her\nmaki lots\nfind it just\nCome home.\nЗіх",
