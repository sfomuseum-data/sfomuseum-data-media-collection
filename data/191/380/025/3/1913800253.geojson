    "media:imagetext": "SHANGHAI\nCHINA\nMARCH 15, 1933\nDear Bixbys\nsecond movie in three days\ntherefore will at least\nmake a start on a letter.\nWe, Pawley and Polin, went to see\nI cannot recommend it as a part of the entertainment program for a\nconvent. Maybe the\ncondon on t as a tive to china as the U.S. Anyway it was plenty rough.\nnesday. On Monday we went to see John Barrymore in\nway of thinking\nA Bill of Divorcement\" which to my\nis a great movie. Afterwards we went to a new Chinese dance hall which\nhas just been started. The building is a one story affair elaborately decorated in the\nmost approved ( by Skouras Bros. ) style - thoroughly American.\nThe hall is about one\nhundred and fifty feet square. There are no posts at all. Around the edge of the large\ndance floor are tables where you can sit and order drinks, the tables being arranged in\nrows about three deep. A sign as you enter announces in several languages\nuniforms are not admitted. At one end an American jazz band of women musicians, music\nlovers might object to that description, who played all the very latest American jazz\nmusic.\nImmediately around the hall seated on chairs there was a row of Chinese \"host-\nesses\" who dance with the guests for ten cents Mex per dance. There were at least two\nhundred Chinese and foreigners present. No one was drunk,\nin fact I have not yet seen\nanyone full in China except some of our countrymen,\nand those appeared to be on one of\nthe\nmany cruises which put into Shanghai for one or two days. Many of the Chinese girls\nof the hostess variety and also others who came with escorts, wear American clothes.\nMost of them dance very well, but the men aremostly in the beginner class. They are\nawfully funny, perfectly dead in earnest, no exchange of small talk, no change in ex-\npression and apparently they are bored to death - except that they are very Scotch -\nand certainly would not be there if they were not getting what they consider their\nmoneys worth. I danced with two of the hostessess - one at a time - and they were as\ngood as either Gloria or Lucy Bixby\n- I mean as dancers. They tried to talk a few words\nof some language possibly English\nbut I couldn't make out what it was all about. Anyone\nover here who is not Chinese is a \"foreigner\", the Chinese not being able to tell an\nAmerican from an Englidhman, Frenchman or what have you, One girl who knew Mr. Polin\nwas named Mary McTavish, her Father was unit a Scotchman, as you might guess by her name,\nand her Mother was Chinese. She is quite pretty and works as a stenographer for one of\nMr. Polinis friends. These Eurasians, as any offspring of mixed races is called out\nway of thinking most unfortunate. They are frequently disowned by both\nwhose Grandfather was English, Grandmother Indian - thats too long a story to write out\nthe net of it is that she is a combination of English, Indian,\nChinese, Japanese and\nItalian and will probably marry a Greek - so figure that out. The famous statement of\nBill Robertsons to Harry\nGuggenheim that one nice thing about China was that \"there were\nno Jews over there\" is like most of Bill's statements not entirely correct. Mr. Polin\nis a perfect peach, but he should not eat ham. He introduced us to another Irishman by\nthe name of Ginsburg who with a crowd of fellow Welshmen,\nSolomon and Strauss were\nseated at a nearby\ntable. We had a lot of fun and I wish Bo and Frances could have seen\nme stepping around with my accustomed grace with those Chinese girls.\nThey wore the\nconventional Chinese dress with high collar which would make Queen Mary's costumes 100k\npositively indecent. I felt like George Merck dancing with Jane Hotchkiss, or Theron\nCatlin with Kitty Guy - take your pick.\nHad tea Tuesday with Perry Hutton who called me up when he arrived here\nwith the ex-Marshal Chang Hsieu-liang. Perry is an old barn storming pilot who hails\nIron wichita kansas.\nand used to be out at Lambert Field frequently. He came over here\noriginally with a trimotor Ford to demonstrate in Japan and China. He sold the Ford to\nthe Young Marshalt, and stayed on as his personal pilot. The Marshal as you probably\nhave read has resigned as the war lord of North China because he has been charged with\nthe loss of Jehol, and now Perry will fly him on a pleasure trip to Europe, or may do\nso a little later on. Hutton has been with the Marshal for three years and has some\ngreat stories to tell about being shot at, trips where a forced landing would have\nmeant the massacre of the whole crowd, etc. He also told me some of the inside story on\nthe operations in Jehol which were very interesting.\nMust turn in now and get a little sleep. By the way have you heard how\nthe Charleston was invented? The inventor saw a Scotchman in front of a pay toilet,\nStation HM B\nShanghai signing off",
