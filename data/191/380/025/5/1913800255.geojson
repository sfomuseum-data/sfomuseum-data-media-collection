Hope\nRalph was able to handle that for us.\nPoor Henry he has a real\nproblem with\nKitty. As you say she is just plain poison, and is\ngetting worse all the time.\nThe Income tax matter is\nOK. I should have told you about that but it was one\nof the things I failed to do. The Treasury Dept. was\ntrying to take advantage of a technicality to cheat\nme out\nof # 2,000.00 and I think that by filing an\nammended return I\nwill ultimately be able to get some\nmoney back which I have already paid. Your Father's\nauditor fixed up the ammended return for me and it is\njust possible that he may be able to represent my int-\nersts without waiting until 1934. You might send this\nletter, or this part of it to your Father with a re-\nport of what Aud's lawyer wrote for you to the author-\nities in Washington. X\u0026\nRegarding\nRalph's assignment to our children\nI wish you would write to the ST.L Union and tell them\nthat you know I do not want that done.\nLots 7 lots of hoir. Bus",
