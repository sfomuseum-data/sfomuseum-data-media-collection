    "media:imagetext": "SHANGHAI\nAPRIL 15, 1933.\nDear Family;\nThis is the first ciroular letter in a long time. I have been very busy\nsince the first of this month with the affairs of Ch ina National Aviation Corp. which\nis the Chinese Aviation company purchased as of April first by Pan American. The line\nis 55% owned by the Ministry of Communications and 45% by P.A.A. It runs from Shanghai\nup the Yangstze River over 1000 miles to Chungking. Another lin e runs from Shanghai to\nPeiping which is 800 miles by air north of here. A line which has been projected is the\none from here to Canton which is another 1000 miles to the south.\nLast weekond I spent with the Minister of Communications and his wife at Hang-\nchow, about 100 miles south of here. The party consisted also of a man named Wong who\nis an adviser of the M. of C, Mr. Tai who is Managing Director of China National Aviatia\nCo., and the Ministers little eight year old daughter. Sunday morning we visited the most\nfamous temple in all China. One of the outstanding attractions is a large beautifully\ncarved wall of the temple dedicated to the Whittemore children - at least it depicts\nchildren asking fifty seven\ndifferent questions, dont know why there are fifty seven\nquestions but that is the number of carvings. The country around Hangchow is perfectly\nbeautiful and the roads fairly good. After a long drive we wound up at a Chinese restu-\nraunt where we found some more guests - all Chinese. I was the only foreigner present.\nWe had sharks fins, rice wine, chicken soup and all the usual Chinese food and then the\nreal special treat - believ e it or not - live shrimps. The brought in a dish with a\ncover over it. When the cover was raised a shrimp jumped right out on the table and one\nof the gentlemen present grabbed said shrimp with his chop sticks and stowed him below.\nGosh how I wished brother Bill had seen that, The shrimps are soaked in or rather hot\nrice wine is pored over the shrimps and they get very active. I knew that I would lose\na lot of face if I showed any weakness so just reached into the dish with my sticks got\nhold of a shrimp who was not as active as some of the others and hoped that he wouldnt\nholler \"help\". Lots of old residents out here have never been up against that experience\nalthough they have all heard about it. Now my education is complete\nexcept for snakes.\nI hope to try them when I go to Canton where they are a speciality.\nI really like the\nChinee \"chow\" as it is called out here. The cooking, like the dialect, is different in\neach province.\nMonday we went on an all day hike to a temple on the top of a mountain\nabout the hight of Buck Mt. but the climbing was not as hard. The climb was not very\npleasant because of the beggars who literally lined the path, but coming down we took a\nsmall path which led down the other side of the Mountain and the walk was grand. The\nwhole mountain side one mass of flowers, white and various shades of pink ezelias ? with\nother small bushs and thousands of wild flowers. The finest tea in the world is grown in\nthis section of China and brings one dollar Mex per ounce. We saw them picking it. aci\nBic",
