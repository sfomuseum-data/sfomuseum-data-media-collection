    "media:imagetext": "CATHAY HOTEL\nSHANGHAI APRIL 29, 1933\nI have been very busy negotiating with the various Chinese officials who\nare directly or indirectly interested in Commercial aviation. T he Post Office is under\nthe Commissioner of Posts who in turn is under the Minister of Communications, each of te\nseveral officials with whom I hav e to deal has a number of advisors, secretarys ete ete\nTime is of absolutely no concern\nto any of them and the surest way in the world not to\nget what you want is to try to rush them.\nThe moment they think you are trying to hurry\nthings along that is the sign to cease firing\nand drop back. They go on the theory that\na year or two more or less is of no consequence at all. That anyone who tries to push\nahead has something to cover up and therefore is interested in making away with the sale\nhis gold brick before the tarnish begins to show.\nTherefore I have had to appear at\nall times as though time was no consideration. It is fatal also for any foreigner to say\nanything about going home or reserving space for a certain date unless he has everything\ncompletely buttoned-up. The moment they think you are about to leave they start bringing\nout new objections,\nand knowing that you cannot afford to go home with nothing done,\ndepend on forcing all sorts of concessions. The foregoing sounds as though I did not like\nthe Chinese, which as a matter of fact is far from the truth. I am really strong for them.\nThey are terribly hard traders, have a system all their own and hav e learned in the bitter\nschool of experience that the foreigners who visit China on commercial business are mostly\nhere to exploit the people for whom they profess such ardent friendship. Many foreigners\nwho have bribed or cheated themselves into a situation complain about the treatment they\nhave received.\nWhen the facts are known you will usually find that the Chinese have done\nabout what anyone else would have done under similar circumstances. I have no patience\neither with the great majority of foreigners who having liv ed in China for many many years\nstill find all sort of fault with the Chinese, call them a lot of crooks thieves and robber\nand generally run down the country and everyone in it. I dont think any of us are over\nour health and if we make a living out of our residence in China we ought to either\nget along without beng so critical or go home.\nand I have taken a room or rather suite of rooms on the fifth floor\nof this hotel overlooking the Bund, the cost in my case at least being less than I was pay-\ning before. Our suite is what the publicity man for the hotel calls the Indian Suite. It\nroom is about twenty feet square and off that is an office about the same size. There are\ntwo large closets and also two trunk rooms large enough to hold ten trunks each. The whole\nMy companion on this trip Groeger sailed for home last Sunday. He was the happiest\nDutchman in the world. He had been to the Philippines and all around, finished his survey\nand done a grand job of it all. The dirt and lack of order in China had I fear got on his\nteutonic nerves. Then too he was deathly afraid of all the small places and feared constant-\nly that he was going to be taken by bandits or pirates. Of course most of the stories you\nread at home are wrong - it is about as fair to judge China by the stories which get into\nthe newspapers as to judge America by the Hearst head lines or the impression that many\nhave that Chicago is a place where you will be very lucky to escape being mowed down by\nmac hine gun fire.\nThere are lots of rumors around that the Yangstz e River for instance is\nlined on either bank by bandits who shoot passengers just for fun, The fact is that in three\nyears of regular operation of China National Aviation Corporation for over a thousand miles\nup the river our pilinta pilots have flown entirely unmolested except that one pilot was\nshot in the leg by a stray bullet or the plane was actuallyfired upon by someone who prob-\nably thought it was a Japanese bomber for the particular incident happened during the\nJapanese trouble a year ago. I asked Groeger to get in touch with Debby and show her all the\nplunder which he took home for Pawley and incidentally give her the few things which I hav e\ndared to purchase and last but not least tell her about our trip and my present state of\nhealth and behavior - both of which thank you are excellent.\nThursday night I went to a Movie Queen ball. It was one of those charity affairs\nstaged in all American towns and usually sponsored by the Elks or some Rotarian type of\nbores.\nHere however it was quite new and the sponsors were Sir Victor Sassoon and Mrs. Dr.\nFearn. The latter is a sister of Mrs. Oscar Johnson of St. Louis and remembered Father and\nMother very well from their trip of 1919. I went to the ball\nas her guest. The Chinese\nbeauties were really good looking in their Chinese dresses. The prize however was won by a\nRussian and she will get a free trip to Hollywood, which however probably does not suspect\ntaht she is on her way. She was very good looking but will probably not get very far in the\nThis is Saturday night and I am glad to have an evening to myself but I do have\nsome work to do so will sign off. I do not even dare suggest to you when I may be able to\nLeave here for Hong Kong and Manila, but it will almost certainly not be for several weeks.\nMy very best to you all",
