    "media:imagetext": "agere at Chungking have gone back to the city and Mr. Chaplain Postal\nCommissioner at Shanghai, who is on the trip with us, and I are stay-\ning at the airport over night. We hope to get away early tomorrow mor\nning, fly to Chengtu 175 miles by air ( two weeks by sedan chair) and\nreturn here the same day. We would like to spend more time there but\nI should be back in Shanghai as soon as possible and by returning\ntomorrow I can catch the regular plane from Chungking to Hankow on\nFriday and then connect with the regular plane out of Hankow for\nShanghai\non Saturday.\nWe have had a marvelous trip so far. Left Shanghai Friday morn-\ning and flew above great white fleecy clouds all the way to Hankow.\nThe sun was shining brightly on the clouds and through the holes in\nthe clouds we could look down another two or three thousand feet to\nthe rice fields below. At Hankow we were held up by bad weather all\nday Saturday which we spent\nin the Hankow Country Club watching a\nbase ball game taking a swim and in the evening going to a picture\nshow (Washington Masquerade) and if you please playing 18 holes of\nminature golf. The following morning, Sunday, we left Hankow and flew\nwestward along the Yangstze to Ichang where the gorges begin. We then\nfollowed the cavern like Yangstze for more than a hundred miles, the\nsame route was taken by Father and Mother and Ralph in 1929 but it ro\nquired almost a week for them against an hour for us. I took along a\nborrowed camera and got some good movies of the gorges, that is I took\nsome great shots if they turn out O.K. Plan to have the films devel-\noped and send them to Debby with the request that she forward them to\nRalph if he is not at the Lake. We had\nthe good fortune to catch up\nwith the regular plane of CNAC while in the gorges and I got some good\npictures of that ship in the air. It was the first time that two air-\nplanes ever went through the gorges together and the natives were so\nimpressed that they forgot to pull their boats up stream while we were\nflying over head, but instead just stared up at us.",
