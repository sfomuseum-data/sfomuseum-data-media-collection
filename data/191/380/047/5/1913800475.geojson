    "media:imagetext": "Chungking is a city of over one million people. It is built\non a steep hill and the streets are nothing but steps. We arrived at\nthe airport at which I am now writing on a typewritter of the air-\nadvisor to General Liu a Frenchman, and went up to Chungking from here\non a boat which belongs to the Standard Oil Co. We called on Admiral\nHo who has charge of the \"Battleships\" belonging to the Warlord and\nthen crossed the river to the section where all of the foreign resid-\nents live ( the foreign colony numbers about 30) There is no hotel at\nChungking. Our people always stay with the representative of the Stan-\ndard Oil Co., but Mr. Chapelain and I went to the Postal Commissioners\nhouse for the night. He is a Dane. He arranged for a chair for me and\ntold me just where to catch it, but by the time I got back across the\nriver it was almost dark. My chair was waiting for me. I got in and\nthe carriers started alon a narrow path up the mountain side. The\nslope and hight was about the same as Shelving rod. At times we went\nalong the edge of cliffs where the slightest slip would have meant\ndisaster. It was a new experience which is now after three days quite\nthe common thing\nto do but that first trip will remain with me for a\nH--- of a long time. The house to which I was taken is a most facin-\nating place built in the Chinese style surrounded by a beautiful gar-\nden .\nThe inside was full of reallyfine things collected during the ter\ntwenty odd years of residence in China of two very nice and tremend-\nously interesting people Mr.and Mrs. Holm. They had a dinner party for\nMr. Chapelain and me that night. I was the only American present. There\nwere three Frenchmen, one Swiss, one English, two Germans, one Dutchman\none Chinese, one Russian and one Italian. They all spoke nothing but\nEnglish which was something of a break for me.\nThe next night Monday\nI spent with the Standard Oil man and his wife. Coming down the next\nmorning (it takes an hour to walk or be carried up to his place) we\nwalked right by an opium den and stopped at the door to take a 100k.",
