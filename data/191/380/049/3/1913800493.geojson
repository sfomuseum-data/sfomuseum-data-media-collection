    "media:imagetext": "No one raised any objection. In this provinc\nurg is raised like\nanyother crop and there is apparently no attempt at all made to stop\nthe smoking of it. In this particylar place the house opened right\non the street or rather path which leads through a small Chinese vil-\nlage on the way to the Standard Oil residence. The men inside were\neither asleep or smoking. I am buying an opium pipe and lighter to\nbring home with me. The stores sell them and my outfit will cost about\nten dollars or about two fifty u.s. money.\nThe quarters where I am now are in an old temple. The Warlord\nhas converted the temple into a barraks and has built an aviation\nfield. He has ten flyable airplanes all very old and funny looking.\nLast year however when he licked his Uncle at Chengtu the airplanes\njust about won the war for him so he is very enthusiastic about flying\nand has been a big help to us. The present war has not reached a s\nstage of sufficient importance to call out the air force but hints\nare now being circulated that if the other side does not come to time\npretty soon Marshall Liu will drop a few bombs.\nWhile I am writing this letter my French host is out on the\nrain drenched flying field shooting an aigret. There are lots of\nthose beautiful white birds there but it is not the right season for\nthe plumes. Also even here it is against the law to export the feathes\nor whatever you call the aigrets,\nYou should pass the stamps on this envelope to some collector\nDeb please send yours to Aud. You will notice that some characters\nare stamped across the face of the stamp. The reason is that the\ncurrency of this province is so depteciated that residents of Chungkig\nhave been buying stamps here with local money and shipping the stamps\nto Shanghai and other points thereby reali\na profit of about ten\ngood only if the letter\nMust stop now and pay some attention to my host who is just\ncoming in. Will mail this letter by airmail from chengtu tomorrow\nand it will be one of the first airmail letters to be carried from\nthat city.\nAs ever Harold",
