They near the coast, generally moving along the\nChina coast over Korea, Japan and the North Pacific. Before\nwe left Honghong for Manila, we knew what the weather was\nall the way through, and the same thing coming back - and\nthe reports were perfect. We had a tug standing by at\nHongkong in case of trouble, and we were in touch by radio\nsheps\nwith things on and near our course the entire way. On\neach crossing the ocean was quiet, and we could have landed\nsafely anytime. So all the heroics or rashness was equally\nunwarranted. At any rate the people in Manila were certain-\nly grand to us - high officials dropped whatever they were\ndoing and gave us all sort of statistics which it would\nhave taken weeks to get any other way. The business commu-\nnity of Manila were just as anxious to co-operate - also\nG. 32. 1000 18-8-33 M. P. C.",
