      "А\nSeptember 1933.\nDear tattles,\nWe are now flying from Foochow to Shanghai on the\nlast leg of our survey flight to the Phillipines - and will soon\ncomplete trip covering 4,400 miles altogether. We have had\nsome interesting experiences, but really and literally \"nothing\nto write home about so this letter will just sort of ramble\nalong.\nThe most interesting part of the trip was the one\nto Zamboanga from Manila.\nA year ago, there was an American over here,\nnamed Brophy, who started out from Macao near Hongkong, to\nfly to Manila.\nHe was\ninexperienced, had a defective com-\npass and couldn't have made the trip with the amount of gas\nthat he carried.\nThe sad, or at least one sad part of the\nstory was that he took a dog with him. Well anyway, nothing\nwas ever heard of Brophy, and the general public uninformed\non the facts regarded the flight as extremely hazardous. As\na result in Manila, we were given a lot of credit for being\nbrave, or criticism for being fool-hardy - neither of which\nwas deserved.\nThe flight from Hongkong to the Island of Iuzon\nis only a little over 500 miles and with a compass anywhere\nnear right it would be hard to miss Luzon and the Phillipine\nIslands.\nThe weather reports for that section of the\nworld are probably the most reliable and dependable available\nanywhere.\nDuring the last sixty years, the French at\nShanghai, and the Spanish at Manila, Jesuit Fathers have\nG. 32. 1000 18-8•33 M. P. C.",
      "herd.\n( 2 )\nridden hard on typhoons until there is little danger that\none will catch shiyping unawares especially now with radios.\nOut in the China Sea where typhoons occur as frequently as\nsix times per month during the season - July, August, Sep-\ntember, they pay a lot of attention to weather in general\nand Father Selga of Manila in particular.\nThe typhoons,\nalmost all are born in the area betwen Guam and the Philip-\npines - at first the center of the typhoons moors at a\nspeed of 7 to 10 miles per hour, while the velocities arouna\nthe center may reach 100 miles, later the center moves fas-\nter, but seldom over 20 miles yer hour in the China Sea.\nThe typhoons move from their starting place toward the\nWest, usually passing along the Northern end of Iuzon (rarely\ngetting as far South as Manila) toward the Southern coast\nof China. They near the coast, generally moving along the\nChina coast over Korea, Japan and the North Pacific. Before\nwe left Honghong for Manila, we knew what the weather was\nall the way through, and the same thing coming back - and\nthe reports were perfect. We had a tug standing by at\nHongkong in case of trouble, and we were in touch by radio\nsheps\nwith things on and near our course the entire way. On\neach crossing the ocean was quiet, and we could have landed\nsafely anytime. So all the heroics or rashness was equally\nunwarranted. At any rate the people in Manila were certain-\nly grand to us - high officials dropped whatever they were\ndoing and gave us all sort of statistics which it would\nhave taken weeks to get any other way. The business commu-\nnity of Manila were just as anxious to co-operate - also\nG. 32. 1000 18-8-33 M. P. C.",
      "( 3 )\nthe Navy and wireless people etc. and probably the best of\nall the hely and assistance was from the Dollar Company\nwhich will of course feel the competition of air trans-\nport.\nHohn and Marjory Holliday were very helpful and\nthoughtful. They gave a party for us, and had Governor\nGent Murphy, so that we met him under favourable circum-\nstances, and were well sponsored right from the kick-off.\nJohn is highly regarded by everyone in the Philippines\nand could have had an appointment as one of the Judges\nof the Supreme Court of the Islands but\"he did not chose\nto run\".\nWe left Manila Bay Sunday morning just as the sun\nwas rising. A low ground haze-or fog covered all the\nvalleys - through this shroudlike formation, the mountains\nstuck up into a bright, almost cloudless sky. We flew\nup to Linguan Bay where for safety sake, we refuelad so\nwe had 9 hours\ngas supply for a flight of only about 5\nhours.\nLeaving Luzon, we flew a course which we hoped\nwe would take us over the Pratas Island, but again we missed\nthat Island.\nThe triy across was uneventful. Except for\na few local showers, the weather was perfect and while we\nmissed Pratas Island, we managed to hit Hongkong\"right on\nthe nose\".\nWe landed there a little after 1 p.m. and\nhad lunch at the Hotel, and then Mr. Scott, Managing Direc-\ntor of Far Eastern Aviation showed us around Hongkong. We\nG. 32. 1000 | 3.8.33 M.?.C",
      "( 4 )\ncrossed from the leased territory of Kowloon on one of the huge\nferries which plies back and forth. Arriving at Hongkong, we\nmotored up to Mr. Scott's home, which is about 1000 ft above\nthe Harbour.\nHe has a beautiful house and garden, with a\nview of the Harbour which is hard to beat. We then drove\naround the Island to Repulse Bay and had a swim.\nThe bay is\nunusually beautiful with a perfect sand beach.\nAfter the swim,\nMr. Scott drove us up the Peak.\nPeak Hotel is on the highest\npoint of the Island.\nWhen Father and Mother visited Hongkong,\nthe only means of reaching the Peak was by a tram-car, but now\nthere is a good automobile road from the Ferry up.\nThe best\nway to describe Hongkong is to say it very much resembles the\nview you would get from Dome Island of Buck Mountain --- if you\ncan imagine Buck Mountain almost entirely covered with attractive\nhomes connected by a good motor high-way, with the Peak Hotel\non top.\nThe altitude and grades are about the same as Buck\nMountain.\nThe view from Kowloon is equivalent to that faem\nBuck Mountain\nHow Dome Island.\nIt is the most amazing and\nbeatiful sight I have ever seen.\nThere is nothing real about\nit at all. The lights come on close together against the\nblack back-ground of the mountains, and the whole setting looks\nmost unreal.\nWe returned to the Hotel and left the following\nmorning at day-break, flying along the coast to Foochow.. The\nmost interesting thing to observe along the. Chinese coast is\nthe clever traps which are built to catch the poor fish. Every\nconceivable method is employed, but the most common is a",
      "( 5 )\nfence-like net, shaped like a \"vit with the wide ends bound to-\nwards the land, and at the small end of the \"y\" is a trap made\nlike one of our minow buckets. The whole arrangement so laid\nout is to trap any fish which comes near shore when the tide\nis in, and takes his time about leaving when the tide goes out.\nYou see miles and miles of these traps, sometimes 3 to 4 deep.\nand as the tide goes out the men are working at the small end\nof the \"y\" letting the fishes into baskets or where the opera-\ntion is condueted in a larger scale into waggons drawn by\nWater buffaloes.\nAs we approached Foochow, our radio operator\nstarted\n\"talking\" to the operator on the President Hoover, and\nwe received a request from the Captain of the Hoover to pay\nhim a call at sea. We then changed our course slightly and\nabout 20 miles out sea, we sighted the Hoover on its way from\nShanghai to Hongkong and Manila. We flew very low over the\nship and threw some Sunday Manila newspapers (this was about\n10 o'clock Monday morning) on board. We rolled the papers ur\ntight and bound them with wire, and a little later as we cir-\noled the ship, the Hoover's operator sent greetings from the\nCaptain thanking us for the call and stated that he would frame\none of the papers. We in return sent message thanking him\nfor his salute which we saw, but did not hear \" 3 puffs of steam\nfrom the whistle\". Leaving the Hoover we went on to Foochow.\nYou may remember some reports about the American Consul at\nFoochow asking for an American battleship to be sent there on\naccount of communistic raids. We got there while the situa-\ntion was at its worst. The Communists who are really or-\nganized bandits, were operating approximately 100 miles North\n0. 32. 1000 18•855 Mr.",
      "( 6 )\nWest of Foochow.\nTheir practice is to surround a city, plunder,\nloot and rob everyone and everything within the city and then\nset fire to the place, so that wherever they go they leave be-\nhind a bankrupt and really ruined community.\nThis particular\ncoup seems to be well lead and had been so successful, it\nappeared certain that they would close in on Foochow and on\naccount of that, the port was given protection by battleships.\nThe Consul at Foochow is a good friend of ours, and we spent\na good interesting half an hour talking about the situation,\nwhile the plane was being refueled. We then took off for\nShanghai and arrived here about 4 p.m., to hear all about a\ntyphoon which had caused lots of damage the day before. So\nfar as we know, our flight was the first one ever made from\nManila to Shanghai.\nDels - did nt have a chaner\nto hair this story typewritten\nuntil now Sept. 30h.
