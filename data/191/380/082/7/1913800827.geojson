The whole arrangement so laid\nout is to trap any fish which comes near shore when the tide\nis in, and takes his time about leaving when the tide goes out.\nYou see miles and miles of these traps, sometimes 3 to 4 deep.\nand as the tide goes out the men are working at the small end\nof the \"y\" letting the fishes into baskets or where the opera-\ntion is condueted in a larger scale into waggons drawn by\nWater buffaloes.\nAs we approached Foochow, our radio operator\nstarted\n\"talking\" to the operator on the President Hoover, and\nwe received a request from the Captain of the Hoover to pay\nhim a call at sea. We then changed our course slightly and\nabout 20 miles out sea, we sighted the Hoover on its way from\nShanghai to Hongkong and Manila. We flew very low over the\nship and threw some Sunday Manila newspapers (this was about\n10 o'clock Monday morning) on board. We rolled the papers ur\ntight and bound them with wire, and a little later as we cir-\noled the ship, the Hoover's operator sent greetings from the\nCaptain thanking us for the call and stated that he would frame\none of the papers. We in return sent message thanking him\nfor his salute which we saw, but did not hear \" 3 puffs of steam\nfrom the whistle\". Leaving the Hoover we went on to Foochow.\nYou may remember some reports about the American Consul at\nFoochow asking for an American battleship to be sent there on\naccount of communistic raids. We got there while the situa-\ntion was at its worst. The Communists who are really or-\nganized bandits, were operating approximately 100 miles North\n0. 32. 1000 18â€¢855 Mr.",
