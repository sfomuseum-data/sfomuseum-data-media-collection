      "23rd September 1933.\nShanghai.\nPersonal \u0026 Confidential.\nLetter No.\nMr.\nPacific American\nPio Amerian Airweyst,\nNew York.\nDear Mr. Morgan,\nThis is thefirst opportunity\nthat I have had to\nmorning)since reggipt of your letter regarding Howard.\nis an extremelyletter for me to write because of my warm personal\nfriendship for Howard, and the personal gratification which I\nwould have in being associated with him.\nIn my opinion, he is\nqualified in every way to represent Fan American Airweys as\nDivision Manager of the Company's Fer Eastern operation.\nHe hes\nthe complete confidence of\nevery one with whom he came in contact\nduring his stay in china.\nHe has a good general knowledge of\nChinese economicz and\npolitical affairs, and he is possessed of\na happy faculty\nof getting along with the Chinese.\nI hope you\nwill pardon my frequent reference to this quality; as a matter of\nSome-one has defined the word \"gentleman\" as a *man\nwho is always\nconsiderate of others!\nis ho country which\nI have ever visited where the quality breeding and gentlemanly\nconduct is as important as in China.\nA report of the slightest\naffront to the lowest coolie will quickly travel to the highest\nofficials, and the party guilty of\nsuch\nconduct toward any Chinese\nwill find\nhimself blocked in any undertaking which he may attempt\nwithout evelt knowing the reason.why such obstacles are thrown in\nhis way.\nHoward is keenly awere of this sensitiveness and pride\non the part of\nthe Chinese.\nI wodid never have to worry about his\nconduct in that regard.\nHe is correct in his statementll that he has had\nconsiderably experience in conducting negotiations with Chinese\nofficials.\nIn those negotiations he was tactful and straight\nforward; he is inclined to take things very seriously and to\ncarry his problems home with himto worry over all night, which\nin my opinion is a weakness.\nHoward has undoubtedly received\nother offers to return to Chine as representative of various\nconcerns desiring to sell products to\nthe Chinese Government.\nHe would undoubtedly rather join Pan American Airways.\nHe is\nhe is in no\nsense a high\npressure salesmen,\nentirely in his wearing qualities.\nAnswering the 3 points enumerated in your letter\nspecifically:-\n• ESTO.ISI.PIoS",
      "(2 )\nMr. S.. Morgan, President, New York. Sept. 24th.\n1) In my opinion Howard is qualified for the position\nfor which he is applying.\n2) I do not believe that a second man is necessary at this\nthis time.\nIf we should commence operations\nto Manila\nand Trans-Pacific, a Devision Manager would be required\nto cover a very extensive system, and there should be\nin my opinion a competent man in cherge at all times\nat Shanghai or where ever our Far Eastern headquarters\nmay be established.\n3) If Howard should be selected, I think a fair and adequate\ncompensation for him would be the same salary\nwhich he\ndrew from the Department of Commerce, the amount of which\nyou can easily determine by consulting Leighton Rogers.\nThe figure which Howard mentioned of G.$7,500 appears to\nme about\ncorrect, and would have the additional merit of\nunder him, This whole\nupon my\nreturn to New York along with many other problems\nhaving to do with personel and organization.\nIf in your opinion it is advisable to employ Howard now\nbecause of other offers he is considering or for any\nother reason, I would suggest that he be given an opportu-\nnity to nity to fly over the greater part of the routes operated\nby the Pan Anerican system, and be also given a thorough\ntraining in Pan American methods, executive,\nengineering,\noperations, comminications and traffic, and\nthat he then\nbe sent to\nchina with a view of developing him as a No.2\nman in\nthe Far East division, fully capable of filling\nthe No.l position.\nAt this point,\nI believe that it is my duty to say to\nyou at the present writing\nthat I am entirely satisfied with the\nposition which I occupy in the Pan American organization, that I\nbelieve that we shall be successful in our negotiations,\nand that\nI shall be very glad of an oppotunity to return to the Far East\nfor the Company.\nIt is my desire to complete the contracts\nwhich I was sent over here to negotiate and\nthen return to New\nYork for the purpose of discussing,\nin details many problems of\nan economical, political and organzing nature which cannot be\ncarried\nout by correspendence.\nI would then like to have\nan @portunity to caciver\nabove outlined for Howard.\npon to the too of the one\nwould then like to return to the\nFar East bringing Mrs. Bixby and our teo youngest daughters with\nus, leaving\nthe two older girls at Farmington to finish their\neducation.\nI am writing so agh fully concerning my personal\naffairs because I believe that you are entitled to know what\nI have in my mind for the future, ani so far as that programme\nmay\neffect\nthe Company's business.\nIt appears now as though I\nwill not be able to complete the work here in less than two\nmonths as a minimum.",
      "( 3)\nMr. S. V. Morgan, President, New York.\nAssuming now that you are satisfied with my efforts on\nthen it will\nbe advisable to employ Howard and sent him out here to take my\nplace while I am home and in any event to provide\nthe Company\nwith a man who is capable of doing my job.\nWith\nall due modesty,\nthere is no one now in the present\norganization how here who is\nqualified to succeed me. That\ncondition is one which should not\nexist in any\nwell organized Company.\nHoward in my opinion has\nnecessary\n10 he Division Manager In the rar Bast, but he undoubtedly\nto represent the Pan American organiza-\nneeds\ntraning and experience in Pan American methods ( as I do also) in\norder to be of maximum value\nto the Compeny.\nWith kindest regards,\nVery sincerely yours,\nH.
