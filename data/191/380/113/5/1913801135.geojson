A.\nDear Mr. Ball,\nYour letter of July 29th reached me shortly\nafter my return from Manila, but the party whom I wanted\nto talk to about representing you here, was out of the\ncity, and only just now I had the opportuhity of hearing\nfrom him as per letter enclosed herewith.\nYou remember that when I\ncame out here you\ngave me the name of Carl Nahmmacher as a possible representative\nof Monocoupe in China.\nDuring my long stay in China I have\nbecome very well acquainted with Nahmmacher and his partner\nL. A. Lewis.\nAs a matter of fact, while Nanhmmacher and\nLewis are partners, they operate separately by reason of the\nfact that Nahmmacher is the representative of United Air-\nTransport, and that Company does not permit their representa-\ntive to handle any other line, therefore Lewis acts as repre-\nsentative for she Fleet likoomyeny and he woula also have to\nact for Monocoupe. I have no reservation whatever with regard\nto the integrity of either Nahmmacher or Lewis. They have done\nfairly well in China, recently having sold 6 fleets and 15\nBoeing Pursuits, and previously sold 30 fleets to the, School\nin Hangchow.\nTheir financial\nresponsibility is somewhat limited,\nThey run a garage which is their bread and butter and the\naviation business, I would say, is the cake.\nIn my opnion, you\nwould be perfectly safe in sending a Monocoupe out here on\nSENTO, (SIAOS",
