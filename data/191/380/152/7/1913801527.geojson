      "Dec 7 1933.\nShanghai\nDear Panily.\nRunning true to form I am writing another circular letter\nfrom the air.\nThis time its on a trip from Shanghai\nto Peiping (Peking\nPeiping, by the way,\nmeans City of Peace of which it has very\nlittle.\nPeking means Northern Capital so when the capital was moved\nNanking the\nname was changed.\nAll of the foreign powers had acquir-\nand built embassies in Peking so they just stayed on after the\nwas moved and now there exists the unusual and possibly happy\ncircumstance of all the diplomats being located approximately 1000\nmiles away from the government.\nWe left Shanghai on schedule time at 7 a.m.\nOur course is\nnorthward across the Yangesze and the fertile delta\nland where every\ninch of land is cultivated,\nand houses a living or dead Chinese.\nThere are graves everywhere but aside from those and small houses\nhuddled together in small villages, all the land is neatly cultivated -\nActually there\nis nothing on the ground in all\nChina that is neat.\nus south of Soochow and a line of villages which marks the route of\nthe grand canal, that oldest and longest of man-created waterways in\nthe world.\nWe cross the Yangtze at Nantung near which we have an\nemergency landing field.\nIt is a beautiful day - max brilliant sun-\nshine\nthermometer about 60 degrees but we are warned that there is\nsnow at Peiping and freezing weather.\nOur flight is about parallel\nto the coast with the first stop 300 miles north of Shanghai at a\nplace called Haichow - not on many maps but its about 60 miles north\nof the old mouth of the Yellow River,\nwhich stream (often called China's\nSorrow because of the havoc caused by it in flood time) changed its\ncourse back in 1852.\nWe have just passed over the old river mouth\nand landed at Haichow to deliver the mail and take on a load for\nTsingtao, Tientsin and Pei ping. Our agent at Heichow tells us there\nIn the small village of only a few\nonly built of stone instead of logs.\nWe see similar structures\nin all the towns even some of\nthose which have walls.\nNow we are\nfollowing the China See with Isingtao 120 miles N.N.E.\nThat place\nas you no doubt know was developed as a sort of German Hongkong.\nWorld War came along the English and Japs besieged Tsingtao and\nJapan thereafter held on to it until the Washington Conference of\n1922.\nThen it was turned back to China.\nI have always maintained while having no pretense of being\neconomist,\nthat most progress in is the result of laziness.\ndoes not necessarily follow that lazy people are smart but some of them\nare and so they have given us all sorts of laborsaving devices.\nChinese are not lazy.\nPossibly that fact accounts for their lack of\nAt Foochow our\nstation is near a large rice field.\nChinese farmer and his wife who own the field pump water from the river\non to the field by means of a treadmill which operates a chain gang of\nsmall buckets.\nThe man and woman apparently spend most of their time\nplodding along on that treadmill.\nthey were not so energetic it\nseems to me they would have developed some kind of a windmill to do,\nor at least help\nthat job.\nToday I noticed flying south of Haichow\nof windmill which would do the work for them.\nIt is constructed\nlike the skeleton of a large lampshade.\nThe diameter of the top and\nbottom circles is from 20 to 30 feet.\nThe upper circle is supportea\nconnected to the lower by eight uprights\nof about 10 to 15\nTo these uprights are fastened oblong shaped sails.\nwhole framework turning round on a center axis which in turn drives a\ngear which carries an\nendless chain of little buckets.\nThe whole\ncountryside was covered with these contraptions -\nsome little ones\napparently privately owned and some large\nones evidently community\nAt home probably some drainage district or irrigation district\nbe issuing bonds against them.",
