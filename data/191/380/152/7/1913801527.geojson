      "Dec 7 1933.\nShanghai\nDear Panily.\nRunning true to form I am writing another circular letter\nfrom the air.\nThis time its on a trip from Shanghai\nto Peiping (Peking\nPeiping, by the way,\nmeans City of Peace of which it has very\nlittle.\nPeking means Northern Capital so when the capital was moved\nNanking the\nname was changed.\nAll of the foreign powers had acquir-\nand built embassies in Peking so they just stayed on after the\nwas moved and now there exists the unusual and possibly happy\ncircumstance of all the diplomats being located approximately 1000\nmiles away from the government.\nWe left Shanghai on schedule time at 7 a.m.\nOur course is\nnorthward across the Yangesze and the fertile delta\nland where every\ninch of land is cultivated,\nand houses a living or dead Chinese.\nThere are graves everywhere but aside from those and small houses\nhuddled together in small villages, all the land is neatly cultivated -\nActually there\nis nothing on the ground in all\nChina that is neat.\nus south of Soochow and a line of villages which marks the route of\nthe grand canal, that oldest and longest of man-created waterways in\nthe world.\nWe cross the Yangtze at Nantung near which we have an\nemergency landing field.\nIt is a beautiful day - max brilliant sun-\nshine\nthermometer about 60 degrees but we are warned that there is\nsnow at Peiping and freezing weather.\nOur flight is about parallel\nto the coast with the first stop 300 miles north of Shanghai at a\nplace called Haichow - not on many maps but its about 60 miles north\nof the old mouth of the Yellow River,\nwhich stream (often called China's\nSorrow because of the havoc caused by it in flood time) changed its\ncourse back in 1852.\nWe have just passed over the old river mouth\nand landed at Haichow to deliver the mail and take on a load for\nTsingtao, Tientsin and Pei ping. Our agent at Heichow tells us there\nIn the small village of only a few\nonly built of stone instead of logs.\nWe see similar structures\nin all the towns even some of\nthose which have walls.\nNow we are\nfollowing the China See with Isingtao 120 miles N.N.E.\nThat place\nas you no doubt know was developed as a sort of German Hongkong.\nWorld War came along the English and Japs besieged Tsingtao and\nJapan thereafter held on to it until the Washington Conference of\n1922.\nThen it was turned back to China.\nI have always maintained while having no pretense of being\neconomist,\nthat most progress in is the result of laziness.\ndoes not necessarily follow that lazy people are smart but some of them\nare and so they have given us all sorts of laborsaving devices.\nChinese are not lazy.\nPossibly that fact accounts for their lack of\nAt Foochow our\nstation is near a large rice field.\nChinese farmer and his wife who own the field pump water from the river\non to the field by means of a treadmill which operates a chain gang of\nsmall buckets.\nThe man and woman apparently spend most of their time\nplodding along on that treadmill.\nthey were not so energetic it\nseems to me they would have developed some kind of a windmill to do,\nor at least help\nthat job.\nToday I noticed flying south of Haichow\nof windmill which would do the work for them.\nIt is constructed\nlike the skeleton of a large lampshade.\nThe diameter of the top and\nbottom circles is from 20 to 30 feet.\nThe upper circle is supportea\nconnected to the lower by eight uprights\nof about 10 to 15\nTo these uprights are fastened oblong shaped sails.\nwhole framework turning round on a center axis which in turn drives a\ngear which carries an\nendless chain of little buckets.\nThe whole\ncountryside was covered with these contraptions -\nsome little ones\napparently privately owned and some large\nones evidently community\nAt home probably some drainage district or irrigation district\nbe issuing bonds against them.",
      "Page 2\nWe have just flown over Tsingtao which is a beautiful city\nwith an excellent harbor,\nlanded for mail and are now off again for\nTientsin 280 miles farther north.\nThe weather is\nstill perfect.\nIsingtao we were met by the worst lack of pedigree looking dog you can\nShe meets every plane,\nwaits until the motor stops, then\ndashes up to the\nof his lunch.\nWhile the plane is on the\nbacks away about twenty feet while\nback home to some Chinese farmers house a quarter of a mile away.\nthe pilot, David by name - last name - took a picture of Bond and\nme with the dog - none\nof us will win any beauty contests.\npilot is Tom Wong just recently arrived from the U. s.\nHe speaks\nperfect English - holds an American\ntransport pilots license and is\nas a matter of fact an American citizen having\nbeen born in Chicago.\nWe hope that after six months or\nso as a co-pilot he may become pro-\nficient enough to make him a\nsenior pilot.\nNow all of the No. 1\nname, is German and incidentally was a member of the old von Richthoffen\nflying circus.\nWe are just about to pass over (that sounds Jewish) the\nYellow River some 200 miles north of where it used to flow into the\nThe country is flat - few trees - only around the adobe houses -\neverywhere the\nsame dust colored ground.\nActually it really is most-\nly dust blown in from\nthe Gobi Desert.\nNo canals or water of any kind\nalong here.\nA few more roads than\nfarther south although so far\nhave seen only one automobile outside of the large cities.\nstill one hour out of Tientsin,\nthe sky is overcast - real winter\n- getting colder now.\nTook a little nap just then.\nwith Bond for ten minutes before Tientsin.\nWe have now landed\naz to North China.\nNow approaching Peiping.\nrather uninteresting letter and send it back by this same plane for\nMiss Forbes to write.\nLoor Had"
