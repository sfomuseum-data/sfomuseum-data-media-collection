      "Deb- Just for your\nstur\nOwn in fou Shanghal, December 18th 1933.\nCONF IDENT TAL\nChief Engineer,\nNew York.\nDear Mr. Priester,\ngant\nThe board forwarded\nits report on the crash\n01 NC16V\nlast night.\nThe report\ncontains my own testimony\nwhich sets forth my\nestimate of the situation.\nI have little\nto add\nto the report\nexcept my profound regret that our efforts\nto build up a safe\nand dependable air service in China should\nmeet\nsuch \u0026 handicap\nin its very inception.\nour personnel are loyal and\nintensely\ninterested in our work.\nproposition\nto fly with an old experienced pilot and criticise his handling\nof the plane, or his navigation, without incurring a certain\namount of resentment.\nBut these pilote have accepted my suggestions\nand\ncriticism cheerfully and have assisted our work to the limit\nof their ability.\nAfter flying the line with Rumill several times I was thoroughly\nconvinced of his ability as a pilot and his safe anô\nconservative\njud gement.\nThis is the first crash he has ever had in sixteen years\nof flying and it has nearly broken his heart.\nI have gone over and\nover with him and with Ehmer the conditions leading up to the crash.\nand while it appears evident that he should have turned back sooner.\nI am thoroughlyconvinced that when he made the turn to come back\nho was perfectly certain of his ability to see any obstruction in\nplenty of time to avoid it.\nThe one point that he overlooked was\nthat if he should meet a local fog area under the conditions that\nprevailed, it would blend\nin with\nthe yellow color of the bay and\nhe would not see it in time to avoid it.\nGranted that it was a\nmistake in judgement, it was brought about by most unusual conditions\nand although all of us have flown across that bay a dozen times we\nhave had no previous indication of such a condition.\nFrom all\ntestimony available it is clearly evident that Rumill, knowing that\nthere was clear weather ahead and behind, felt that he had nothing\nto worry about except a hazy condition over the bay.\nOnce he\npicked up the coast line on the other side of the bay he could\ndefinitely check his visibility.\nHe had a full load of passengers\nfor this inaugural passenger flight and had been forced to turn\nback once before. Confident that he was able to see obstructions\nhe proceeded until he became convinced by the fact that the ceiling\nwas dropping and his view of the water getting dimmer, that his",
      "2.\nvisibilitywas less than a mile.\nThen he turned to come back. At\nwhile he might\nHe had the misfortune to come out of his turn at the edge\nof \u0026 local fog bank that surrounded a high island.\nHe\ndid not see\nthe fog bank and he flew right into it, and struck the island an\ninstant later.\nI do not\nfor a moment deny that the crash was avoidable, but\nin my judgement it was excusable under the conditions\nthat prevailed.\nUndoubtedly the pilot was endeavouring to use his best judgement.\nIt is fairly evident that his judgement must have been at fault as\nto the amount of visibility available.\nWith a visibility of a mile\nhe should certainly have been able to detect fog before running into\nit, therefore we reason that his visibility must have been conside-\nless\nthan a mile.\nBut the usual facilities available to a\npilot for checking visibility were lacking in this case.\nI therefore\ndo not feel that it would be\nfair or correct to say that the pilot\ndeliberately proceeded in weather which he knew offered less than\na mile of visibility.\nRumill is as careful and\nconservative a pilot as I have ever\nknown.\nHe is incapable of a,lie and has made no attempt to alibi\nhimself out of any\npossible blame.\nHe will remain grounded until\nyou cable us your decision.\nMy own recommendation is that he be reinstated in our service.\nEvery\npassenger from the crash has expressed an admiration for him\nand for his actions during and immediately after the crash, and\nhave publicly stated their desire to fly with him again.\nI sincerely hope you will not think me unduly sympathetic in\nthis case.\nIf I felt that Rumill had deliberately broken\nour\nsafety rules, and thereby risked the lives of passengers in his care,\nof faot, it is difficult for me\nmore than he deserves, for the reason that the effect of this crash\nis so destructive to our plans and hopes.\nWe had the entire\nconfidence of the public from here to Manila,\nas well as their strong\ninterest and goodwill. Now we have lost a lot of that.\nA lot of\npeople in our home company will\nprobably feel that I don't know my\nThat would be only natural and there is nothing I can say.\nthat you know and understand\nmake this line as thoroughly Pan American as is the Caribbean Division\nin spirit and in actual operating methods.\nIf you believe\nfeel certain that he is thoroughly deserving•\nSince the orash I have been doing Rumill's share\nof the flying\nand it is difficult for me to spare that much time.\nIf you will\nplease cable your decision in this matter we will appreciate it\nvery much.\nWith kindest regards,\nW. S. Grooch\nd 118015l"
