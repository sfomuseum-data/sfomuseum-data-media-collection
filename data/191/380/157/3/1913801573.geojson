      "Deb- Just for your\nstur\nOwn in fou Shanghal, December 18th 1933.\nCONF IDENT TAL\nChief Engineer,\nNew York.\nDear Mr. Priester,\ngant\nThe board forwarded\nits report on the crash\n01 NC16V\nlast night.\nThe report\ncontains my own testimony\nwhich sets forth my\nestimate of the situation.\nI have little\nto add\nto the report\nexcept my profound regret that our efforts\nto build up a safe\nand dependable air service in China should\nmeet\nsuch \u0026 handicap\nin its very inception.\nour personnel are loyal and\nintensely\ninterested in our work.\nproposition\nto fly with an old experienced pilot and criticise his handling\nof the plane, or his navigation, without incurring a certain\namount of resentment.\nBut these pilote have accepted my suggestions\nand\ncriticism cheerfully and have assisted our work to the limit\nof their ability.\nAfter flying the line with Rumill several times I was thoroughly\nconvinced of his ability as a pilot and his safe anô\nconservative\njud gement.\nThis is the first crash he has ever had in sixteen years\nof flying and it has nearly broken his heart.\nI have gone over and\nover with him and with Ehmer the conditions leading up to the crash.\nand while it appears evident that he should have turned back sooner.\nI am thoroughlyconvinced that when he made the turn to come back\nho was perfectly certain of his ability to see any obstruction in\nplenty of time to avoid it.\nThe one point that he overlooked was\nthat if he should meet a local fog area under the conditions that\nprevailed, it would blend\nin with\nthe yellow color of the bay and\nhe would not see it in time to avoid it.\nGranted that it was a\nmistake in judgement, it was brought about by most unusual conditions\nand although all of us have flown across that bay a dozen times we\nhave had no previous indication of such a condition.\nFrom all\ntestimony available it is clearly evident that Rumill, knowing that\nthere was clear weather ahead and behind, felt that he had nothing\nto worry about except a hazy condition over the bay.\nOnce he\npicked up the coast line on the other side of the bay he could\ndefinitely check his visibility.\nHe had a full load of passengers\nfor this inaugural passenger flight and had been forced to turn\nback once before. Confident that he was able to see obstructions\nhe proceeded until he became convinced by the fact that the ceiling\nwas dropping and his view of the water getting dimmer, that his",
