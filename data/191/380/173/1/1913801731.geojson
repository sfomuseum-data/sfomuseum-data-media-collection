    "media:imagetext": "On February 23rd, 1935 at the Bridge House Hotel, Nanking,\nI spent a most interesting evening with Sven Hedin, who was in\nNanking for the purpose of reporting on an expedition from which he\nhad recently returned.\nThis expedition was financed by the Central Government\nand had as its objective the mapping of a road through Western China\nfollowing the ancient silk trail from Lanchow to Hami and Urumchi.\nIt was on this expedition that the famous Swedish explorer gathered\nthe material for a number of books which he later wrote dealing with\nconditions in the Chinese Northwest. It is interesting to note that\nfollowing\nthe outbreak of the Sino-Japanese undeclared war, more than\na million men were put to work to complete this highway over which\nnow move Russian trucks carring munition and supplies to the Chinese\nforces. If the Chinese lose Hankow, this highway will be one of\nthe principal roads used as a connection between China and the out-\nside\nworld•",
