      "Tuesday night we had dinner at\nchow best.\nChinese restaurant - delicious.\nCurfew in\nIt's hot and very highly\nstreets after\nChungking is at 11 p.m. and no one\nthat hour without a pass.\nis permitted on\nescorted us to our rooms\nSo after dinner our\nthe Board room.\nThe pride and\nthe establishment - the flush toilet was about as private\nthe information bureau in Grand Central station and the crowd\nwhich assembled\nproverbial\nwhen I appeared was almost as great.\ngoldfish does\nAfter all the\nhave a little privacy because the public\nbut the location of our F.T. was such that\nstairway provided an unobstructed view for the curious.\noccasionally\nthe bathroom but I now have several\nbeen accused of spending considerable time in\ncharge.\nhundred witnesses to refute any\nWednesday morning our banker friend showed up with three\ntown notables including the mayor and announced to Ki Chun\nnone of them except Ki spoke English -\nbeen ordered in my honor.\na foreign breakfast had\nand forks at each place and we all\nThe directors table was set with knives\nwhich was tomato soup.\nsat down for the first course\nThen our host served each of us with a\ntumbler full of brandy\n- at 8 a.m!\nhimself served and naturally I had to drink.\nIn Chinese fashion he\ntold him that foreigners like brandy.\nSomeone had probably\nAfter the tomato\nhad ham and eggs,\nthen an omelet with fish, then some kind of meat.\nWe had an appointment with the Postal\nhad to excuse ourselves from the breakfast just as\nCommissioner at 9:15 so we\nthe waiters were\neach guest with a half of a chicken.\nOur host begged us\nthe coffee,\nright away but we were\ntoast and beefsteak which would be served\nbanker rather than to our\nalready late and we chose to be rude to the\n\"best customer\"\nthe Postal Commissioner.\nWednesday afternoon the visibility was not too good but\nwe flew over to Chengtu and were very fortunate in having perfeet\nweather after we\ncrossed the last range of mountains.\nwonderfully rich\nsunshine and a\nabudless sky.\nplain stretched out before us in bright\nIt is a densely\npopulated agricul-\nsection with every inch of land\ncultivated much\ndelta land\nthe lower Yangtsze.\nof the ancient\nLike Peking it had its Forbiaden\nused as a recreation park.\nThe great dark massive wall\nsurrounding\nChengtu is not permitted to crumble away nor is there any talk\nabout pulling\nit down\nso that a motor highway can be built around\nthe city as has been done by\nmany other cities.\nChengtu has been\nattacked many times,\n- once it has fallen since I was\nthere less\ntwo years ago.\nJust recently\nthe Nanking Government has extended its\nactual (rather\nthan nominal) control\nto Szechuan\nProvince and\nwithin the last 30 days the\nCentral Government (Nanking)\nbanch of the\nCentral Bank of\n$20,000,000\nChina and shipped over\nto Chungking.\nthe Province and\nChiang Kai-shek made his first trip\nplans to spend a long time in this section\nreorganizing the military and\ngovernmental machinery.\nat Kweiyang effecting\nthe reorganization of\nthat province.\nUntil\nthese two provinces have\npart of China on the map\nbut in all other respects completely independent.\nThey paid\nnothing\nto the National\ntreasury and\ngot nothing from it.\nand losing armies have looted and ravished Szechuen for so many years\nthat the poor\nfarmers and small merchants live in\nconstant fear of\nlittle choice of whether\nthe soldiers are friend",
      "Therefore the well trained disciplined troops of Chiang Kai-shek\nwhich pay for what they take and live in barracks instead of\nmoving into the homes of the populace have been welcomed and\nSzechuen Province should prosper greatly from now on.\nTaxes\nhave been collected through 1974.\nThese will have to be adjusted\nand a better provincial government organized.\nI do not believe\nthat any\nSzechuen war lord will again successfully defy Nanking\nbecause of the latter's air force.\nThe same statement is true of\nKweichow Province.\nFormerly it was quite impossible to successfully carry\nout a punitive expedition against any\nSzechuen war lord,\nat least\nwithout terrific losses and costs.\nNow airplanes can attaok in\na few hours and at only a nominal cost.\nWe returned to Chungking on Friday March 29th and.\nstarted\nfor Kweiyang on Saturday but had to turn back on account of clouds\nclosing the\nmountain tops and passes.\nWe will try again on\nSunday\nand I'll tell you about that part of the trip in another\nletter - this one is already\ntoo long•\never\nHarolo"
