      "Sunday, May 26, 1935.\nDear\nBabs:\nI am on the way\nfrom Chungking\nto Hankow\nafter a most strenuous\nparty in Szechuen\nwhich it was\nquite impossible\nto write and\nif I had written the letter\njust have waited to\ncome along with us\non this plene.\nYou will\nthat we arrived in Chungking last\nMonday and that I did not know what we\nwould do after\ngot there,\nHowever we learned\nthat Chiang Kai-shek was planning to leave Yunnan-fu\nright away\nfor Kweiyang and\nwould arrive Chungking on Thursday so we\nstayed in Chungking for\nan appointment there on Friday.\nJones and\nChevalier went over to Chengtu.\nat Chungking•\nWe were\nbooked solid for\nbreakfast,\nForbes and I remained\ntiffin and dinner with\nmeetings in between.\nmostly long con-\non possible industrial rairo projecte in saehuen Province.\nFriday afternoon Rogers and\nRemer joined us\nthat Remer\nespecially was willing to fly\nagain with CNAC\nafter Broiles\ndumped him\nThey were\nboth good sports in every way\nand I thanked\nsincerely and whole heartedly as I\nsmall bone in his\nright foot and\nbroke one of those short\nmuch pain when I broke\nWell we had made an appointment with the \"Generalissimo\" for\nfive o'clook Friday afternoon.\nGov, Forbes,\nRogers and I were to see him.\nForbes was\nAmerican aviation\ncooperation in general, I was\nGeneralissimo\nRogers Military\nAviation.\nstoried house at the western end\nof the city -\nor is it the\nthe down\ntown part.\nend - at any rate the section away\nIt is on that\nlong road which leads into the high\nto Chengtu.\nWe climbed a long\nflight of stone stairs\nleading from the drive up to the house - soldiers all\naround - soldiers\nwhose uniforms fit them and who wore\ninstead of\n\"sneakers\".\npassed they came to a real\nsnappy salute which we tried to acknowledge\nwith the easy nonchalance of those acoustoned to such deference.\ndoor of a typically foreign house such as you would find\nbelonging to the\nPresident of the First National Bank of Anywhere,\nKansas, we were ushered\ninto a formal parlor and presently General\nChiang and Mrs. Chiang came in.\nGeneral wore \u0026\nuniform without\nany decoration\nor insignia of\nrank -\njust as plain as K. I. Nieh's or old deacon Swann's of the First Congrega-\ntional\nGeneralissimo\"\nis average height and as\"Time\" describes\nhim in their usual flippant manner, wasp-waisted.\nHe is 48 years old but\nlike most other Chinese\nten years younger.\nMadam Chiang is about\ntypically Chinese.\nBeautiful figure, very feminine with lots of\npersonal charm yet obviously forceful.\nShe has a beautiful voice and\nEnglish of so much better quality than our own that you firak\nfeel slightly embarrassed at your\nown awkardness with your own language.\nHer foice and\nmanner is so much like Anne Lindbergh that I couldn't help\nremarking on the resemblance.\nShe seemed pleased\nand spoke of how much\nshe was attrated by the Lindberghs when\nthey visited Nanking in 1931.\nShe was dressed quite simply but wore a jade ring that was probably worth\nalso jade\nfor her husband but on this occasion his personal physician Dr. Liu\nShe ordinarily acts as interpreter\nserved in her place.\nGovernor Forbes had his say and withdrew in my favor.\nlong and most satisfactory conversation with General Chiang•\nThe others\na11\nwithdrew fron our part of the room and we had quite a frank discussion.\nI did not expect an immediate answer to the matters which we discussed but\nhe\n362118860\nbe in accord with our ideas and plans.\nI am qui te\nsure that",
      "eventually we shall\nget some action but I have memorized Kipling's\n\"It is not\ngood for the Christian White\nTo hustle\nthe Aryan Brown\nThe Christian riles\nAnd the Aryan smiles\nAnd he weareth the\nAnd the\nend\nChristian down\nof the fight\nIs a tombstone white\nWith the name of the late deceased\nThis Epitaph\ndrear\nA fool lies here\nWho tried\nto hustle the Bast.\"\nWe planned to leave Chungking on Saturday but Chiang Kai-shek\ninvi ted\nthe whole party\nfor dinner\nSaturday night and\nrequested Gov.\nand Mr. Carroll\nto make an inspection trip in Marshall Chang\nHsueh-liang's Boeing from Chungking to\nChangsha and Nanchang,\non to Shanghai.\nThey are leaving Tuesday.\nto catch the Taft out of Hongkong on Tuesday\nJones\nand I\nare trying\nand we therefore decided\nschedule Saturday in order\nto give us one day's leeway\nfor bad weather\nand also a day at Shanghai.\nHowever Saturday the\nweather turned very bad with low or no visability and we remained in\nChungking which proved to\nbe very fortunate.\nSaturday morning I had\na long talk with Mr.\nDonald,\nnow Chief advisor to Chiang Kai-shek.\nDonald is an Australian who years ago organized a magazine called the\nFar Bast Review.\nIt became very\nsuccessful.\nFinally Mr.\npartner sold out the controlling interest to\nthe Japs and the magazine\nbecame a medium of Japanese propaganda.\ngave up his interest\nbecame an adviser\nfor Chang krunkkixary Tso-lin,\nthe old Manchurian\nHe has subsequently aoted in the same capacity for\nYoung Marshall Chang Hsueh-liang and just now is serving with\nKai-shek.\nChiang\nold friend of Mr.\nand the latter\nthat if I would go to Manila for\nAmerican Mission,\nwhich he\nVice-Chairman and\nGov. Forbes as Chairman both urgently requested,\nthat he Carroll would have a long confidential talk with Donald.\nAccordingly when we did\nnot fly I\nsat in with Carroll and Donald for\na three hour talk in which we discussed the whole\ncommercial aviation\nDonald understands and\npromised to set Chiang and Madam\nwhich is fully as important, straight on the whole subjeot.\ncomplete menoranda with him end he told me that both Chiang\nand Madam Chiang were favorably impressed with my verbal presentation.\nAll of us Americans are in\ntrouble because of\nunwillingness to fly\nbombs into Kweiyang•\nThe Italians (please\ntell Col. Drysdale) did\ngot away without any\nserious trouble.\nHarry Smith who has\nflown Chiang Kai-shek's Ford all\nChina and who even carried bombs\nprotest) has been dismissed so rumor has it;\nReed Knight and\nTonny Taylor,\nHangehow School\ninstructors,\nboth been dismissed\nThey all agreed to carry\nthe bombs if the\ndetonators were removed and\nsent in another\nairplane as for instance\narmy bomber.\ndetonators are in themselves highly\ndanger-\nbombs not so bad - but\nthe\noute candie i eat be just too\ntwo together\nany slight\naccident\nbad.\nwe\nare\ninvolved because the\nMinister\nof Communications was asked to instruct\nGNAC to fly the bombs\nand the Minister\nof\nCommunications without contacting the company wired\nback that Pilot Nelson would do so.\nOf course when Bond and I refused\nto order\nor even ask Nelson to fly bombs the M. of C. lost face and\nthat is of ecurse most\nunfortunate.\nLater we had a talk with M.Y. Tang\nand as a result Bond and I notified the M..\nof C. that we would both\nfly\nto\nto\nChungking for a talk with Nelson,\nIf then Nelson\nwas willing\ntake a leave\nof absence from INAC and go to work for the\nChinese\nArmy on terms of pay satisfactory to him we would give him every\npossible assistance in the way of mechanios service,\nradio, weather\nlata, etc.\nThis\ndeclined - but at least we got credit for making",
      "the offer.\nSaturday night Gov.
