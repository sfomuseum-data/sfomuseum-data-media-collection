      "MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TRUST COMPANY\nA. O. WILSON,\nVICE PRESIDENT\nST. LOUIS\nJune 17, 1935\nHarold\nM. Bixby,\n0% China Atrways Federal, Ino., U. S. A.,\n51 Canton Road,\nShanghai, China.\nDear Harold:\nFor days and days, I have been endeavoring to find time\nto write you a line, but it has just seemed impossible for me\nto do so.\nNow,\nthere is a definite reason for a letter, and it will go forward at once. The\npurpose of this letter is to tell\nyou first about theapproaching visit in your\ncity of one of your long time friends,\nbut there is much more than \"one\" in the\nparty•\nI refer to F. A.\nSudholt, formerly an official of the\nInternational Shoe\nCompany, who, together with his children and grand children, will arrive in\nShanghai\non or about July 28th.\nThey are passengers on the President Grant which\nsails fron Seattle on June 22nd, and they will be in Shanghai on the going trip\nand also when they return from Hongkong on August 12th•\nThe Sudholts are accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Brickenkamp\nand family. Mr.\nBrickenkamp is President of the Lindell Trust Company and related\nto\nthe Sudholts.\nMr. Sudholt retired from active business some time ago and now\nhe is enjoying the money he had accumulated.\nI think it is fine for him to do\nso much for his fanily along the line of traveling and adventure, especially.\nHarold, I just hope that you and Debbie and your fine family\nare all well\nand happy, and, of\ncourse,\nthat includes Mrs. Case.\nI hope she will\nstay over there as long as she can and have a good visit with all of you.\nknow that you and Debbie and the children are very happy to have here with you.\nAccording to the public press, Dr.Holt and wife are back in\nthis country.\nI was glad to learn from your letter of some time ago that you\nactually had been going to church out there in Shanghai•\nPossibly, Dr.\nHolt had\nsomething to do with that.\nI am sure you enjoyed your visit with him.\nI am always\nassuming\nthat you have, through the Associated Press,\nthe facts with reference to\nhappenings back home; so I will not undertake to inform you along general lines.\nSuffice it to say that we really do not know from day to day just what might happen,\nalthough we have recovered considerably from the Supreme Court N. R. A. decision,\nand really we do believe that we are moving along now in a fairly comfortable\nway, so far as general\nbusiness is concerned.\nThe unemployment problem continues\nbe our great menace.\nIt is quite evident that for a long\ntime to come, we\nwill find it necessary to continue a relief program of one kind or another.\nNo\ndoubt,\nthat is the situation all over the world, but you and I did not think it\nwould ever come to pass in this country.\nWith sincerest good wishes for all of you, I am,\nYours very truly,\nA Orville Wilcon\nAOW: EJ\nVice President."
