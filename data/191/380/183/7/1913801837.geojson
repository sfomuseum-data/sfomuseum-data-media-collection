      "Flying to Peiping\nAugust 8th, 1935.\nDear Family:\nI have been pretty much on the go ever since early Spring and as a\nresult my weary readers, have had a much needed rest which the author just now\nwould like to duplicate, sees little chance.\nI an going to spend a few days with\nthe fanily just to get back on speaking terms and say to the children \"ny how\nyou've grown !\"\nThere is really not much to write about other than Chinese and Philippine\nYou wouldn't be interested and I am not qualified to discuss either\nbrand beyond saying that they compare very favorably with our own.\nPhilippines as in Missouri there are a certain number of patriots who are\nvociferously willing to dedicate their lives to the public welfare, get their\nnames on a pay roll and their feet on a desk.\nAfter the Philippine Commonwealth\nis established the number of patriots will undoubtedly increase.\nI had six weeks in Manila daring which time we secomplished a great\ndeal but did not secure favorable action on the franchise\nwhich we tried to\nsecure from\nthe Philippine Legislature.\nHowever, there seens to be no real.\nopposition and we hope that the next session which is called for September 23rd\nwill approve our bill.\nThis is Thursday.\nGot back to Shanghal. Monday afternoon.\nOf cour se\nthere was plenty to do and I brought a lot of correspondence with me to read on\nthe plane and try to answer or dispose of in one way or another.\nlast night one of our best Chinese friends M.Y. Tang came by to see me\nand learning that I was in a meeting wrote me a note.\nIt seems that his niece,\neither actual or adopted, is going to attend some Catholie College in Webster\nthis Winter.\nHer name is Eppy Chang•\nShe is related to Mrs. T.V. Soong and comes\nfrom one of the best families in China.\nDebby and I had lunch with her almost a\nyear ago at a party which Mr. M.Y. Tang gave for Hebe and Catherine.\nvery charming girl, speaks English well and is very good looking.\nI have written\nletters of introduction for her to Ruth, Lucy, Mary Seott, Mrs. Beauregard\n(Lindbergh Trophies) and to Archbishop Glenon. I hope very much that the\nmembers of the St. Louis Bixby clan will show Miss Chang a good time - maybe have\nher around for Sunday dimer or invite her to the Country Club some Saturday night.\nIf she dances as well as most Chinese girls you will fine your boy friends forming\nFlying back to Shanghel Friday August 16th. I was booked to\nreturn on Wednesday but at the request of one of our officials gave up my reserva-\ntion in favor of an important passenger who had to be in Shanghai on Wednesday.\nThe Douglas transport flies up to Peiping on Tuesday, back on Wednesday and up\nagain on Saturday returning Sunday.\nThe other trip is made via Stinson up on\nThursday and back on Friday so, of course, I struck the small Stinson both ways.\nIts funny how soon and how easily you become spoiled.\nThe Stinson nine hour\nschedule used to seem de lux indeed as compared with. 44 hours by train. Now,\nhowever, the Douglas 14 passenger liner with comfortable seats, no noise, 5 hour\nschedule and steward serving tea, coffee, beer, sandwiches etc, makes the Stinson",
      "- 2 -\nseem like the wheel\nbarrow which we just flew over.\nI have always wanted\ntO\nsee\na wheel barrow with a sail and just now I spied one going along a narrow road.\nIt\nwas headed the opposite direction from our route which is another way of expressing\nthe\naviators favorite complaint - i.e., we have a head wind.\nHowever, when you are\nbucking a head wind you usually fly low and that is how it happened that I saw the\nwheel barrow with full rigged square\nof this \"Kansas Yacht\"\nsail.\nThe coolie who was acting as helmsman\nwas stepping along at a lively rate while four people sat on\nthe barrow - two on each side of the \"keel\".\nThe\nsail was about five feet high by\nfour feet wide.\nI have seen pictures of these contraptions but this is the first\none I have ever\nseen in actual use.\nThe \"captain\" did not have to worry like the\nold Cape Cod captain who said he would not sail a brig because he was a\ngood\nCaristian and the bible directed that no good Christian \"could serve two masters.\"\nI had a fine rest at Peiping.\nWhen I arrived found Frances,\nBo and Ruth\nwere away\non a trip to Tai\nYuan Iu, Capital\nof Shansi Province.\nShansi means\n\"west of the mountains\" while Shantung means \"east of the mountains\".\nIn that section\nthere had been heavy rains with reports in Peiping that the rivers were overflowing\ntheir banks, many ci ties wiped out,\nbandits on\nthe loose and the usual number of\nrumors which\nthrive and gain momentun in a country where transportation and\ncommunication is so uncertain.\nDebby was quite worried but Sunday we received a\nvery welcome if inelegant telegram \"hold your noses here we come\".\nAnd sure\nenough Sunday evening about 7:30 the girls descended on us with eighteen bundles\nof loot gathered in Shansi,\nthe packages ranging in size fron small\nboxes to good\nsized Shansi chests.\nIf we had locked the bathroom doors, I think the girls would\nhave traded all their plunder for the keys.\nAfter one day in Peiping, they started\noff early Tuesday morning for a trip to the Diamond Mountains of Korea. It will be\nanother interesting experience for them, and I'm wondering what the hige light will\nbe.\nOn the lastirly it was gun fire. The girls were crossing a big plain in Shansi\nwhen they heard a loud mizzing noise over head, often repeated. In the distance\nthey could hear rifly fire.\nFinally it dawned on them that the whizzing sound\nwas caused by bullets and they proceded in true negro fashion to say \"feet carry\nme away\".\nIt turnd out that they were crossing a rifle range and probably stood\na much better chance of getting hit than if they had been the targets.\nWe are all very sad over the thought of Ruth going home early in\nSepterber .\nShe has been a moal addition to our party in China and we*ll miss her.\nI imagine\nthere will be times during her debutant winter when some boring dimmer\npartner will catch a far away look in her eye and never quite know what the score is,\nbut I know too that she will cary on in St. Louis as she has here taking things\ngood, bad and indifferent, making the most of them all.\nNearing Shanghai nor so will wind up this letter - as ever\nNarolo"
