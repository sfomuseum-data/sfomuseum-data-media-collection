    "media:imagetext": "- 2 -\nseem like the wheel\nbarrow which we just flew over.\nI have always wanted\ntO\nsee\na wheel barrow with a sail and just now I spied one going along a narrow road.\nIt\nwas headed the opposite direction from our route which is another way of expressing\nthe\naviators favorite complaint - i.e., we have a head wind.\nHowever, when you are\nbucking a head wind you usually fly low and that is how it happened that I saw the\nwheel barrow with full rigged square\nof this \"Kansas Yacht\"\nsail.\nThe coolie who was acting as helmsman\nwas stepping along at a lively rate while four people sat on\nthe barrow - two on each side of the \"keel\".\nThe\nsail was about five feet high by\nfour feet wide.\nI have seen pictures of these contraptions but this is the first\none I have ever\nseen in actual use.\nThe \"captain\" did not have to worry like the\nold Cape Cod captain who said he would not sail a brig because he was a\ngood\nCaristian and the bible directed that no good Christian \"could serve two masters.\"\nI had a fine rest at Peiping.\nWhen I arrived found Frances,\nBo and Ruth\nwere away\non a trip to Tai\nYuan Iu, Capital\nof Shansi Province.\nShansi means\n\"west of the mountains\" while Shantung means \"east of the mountains\".\nIn that section\nthere had been heavy rains with reports in Peiping that the rivers were overflowing\ntheir banks, many ci ties wiped out,\nbandits on\nthe loose and the usual number of\nrumors which\nthrive and gain momentun in a country where transportation and\ncommunication is so uncertain.\nDebby was quite worried but Sunday we received a\nvery welcome if inelegant telegram \"hold your noses here we come\".\nAnd sure\nenough Sunday evening about 7:30 the girls descended on us with eighteen bundles\nof loot gathered in Shansi,\nthe packages ranging in size fron small\nboxes to good\nsized Shansi chests.\nIf we had locked the bathroom doors, I think the girls would\nhave traded all their plunder for the keys.\nAfter one day in Peiping, they started\noff early Tuesday morning for a trip to the Diamond Mountains of Korea. It will be\nanother interesting experience for them, and I'm wondering what the hige light will\nbe.\nOn the lastirly it was gun fire. The girls were crossing a big plain in Shansi\nwhen they heard a loud mizzing noise over head, often repeated. In the distance\nthey could hear rifly fire.\nFinally it dawned on them that the whizzing sound\nwas caused by bullets and they proceded in true negro fashion to say \"feet carry\nme away\".\nIt turnd out that they were crossing a rifle range and probably stood\na much better chance of getting hit than if they had been the targets.\nWe are all very sad over the thought of Ruth going home early in\nSepterber .\nShe has been a moal addition to our party in China and we*ll miss her.\nI imagine\nthere will be times during her debutant winter when some boring dimmer\npartner will catch a far away look in her eye and never quite know what the score is,\nbut I know too that she will cary on in St. Louis as she has here taking things\ngood, bad and indifferent, making the most of them all.\nNearing Shanghai nor so will wind up this letter - as ever\nNarolo",
