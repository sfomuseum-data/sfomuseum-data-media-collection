He saw the\ngirls twice in Hono-\nlulu, once for tiffin and once at dinner.\nSaid they were both hav-\ning a grand time, that everyone was crazy abouy them and that they\nwere most enthusiastic about the trip from Manila. George said they\nwere scheduled to leave for the Island of Hawaii the day he was orig-\ninally due to start out here and that when the plane was\ndelayed, he\ncalled up the girls at the hotel and found that they had checked out,\nso he assumes that they made the trip. George couldn't get over how\nwell the girls looked and said that he had never before realized just\nhow beautiful Frances was - he didn't mention Bo in that category but\nsaid plenty about her personality. He saw Gene Sellers at Midway and\nshe told him that she was going back on the same ship with F and B.\nthat seemed to be some comfort to her - am not so sure that the girls\nwill find\nit so convenient.\nNo letter from F or B here addressed to PAA. I am awfully\ndisappointed for I was looking forward to some direct news from them.\nYou will just have to keep whatever letters you receive until I re-\nturn. You might forward letters to Manila, marked hold for H. M.B. so\ni can read\nget back.\nLots of love. Must chase out to\nsee Mrs. Bert Hall now.\nGot vacin-\nated this AM by Doc Howard Smith.\nВіх",
