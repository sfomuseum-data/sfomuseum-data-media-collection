Loonis,\n42 Ularemont Ave.,\nit, Vernon, N.Y.\nMay 26, 1936.\nDear Thirteeners:\nHere's a treat for all of us --\na letter from Steamer Bixby.\nis also noteworthy in heing a letter written in an airplane, probably the\nfirst most of us have ever received.\nApril 20, 1936\nFlying from Shanghai to Nanking.\nDear Dick:\nDuring the last twelve months I have lived in a suitcase.\nMy\ntravels have carried me sometimes rather quickly from 20 below zero to\n100 above.\nFrom Peiping\non the north,\nChengtu on the west in the shadow\nof the high mountains of Tibet, to Manila in the south.\nOne becomes\nsomething of a Houdini packing\nclothes for these extremes; woolens\nand\nwhites,\ndinner coat and mess jacket, all within the fifteen kilo (33 lbs)\nweight limit.\nMy office has been a brief case in which my record of\nnever having the particular document needed is practically 100%.\nDuring\nthis time I have neglected my correspondence but rolled up quite a mile-\nage which I have just computed roughly as follows:\nAirplane miles (mostly over China)\nSteamship niles\nRailroad\n25,000\n14,000\n2,500\nAutomobile, bus, ricksha,\nsedan chair and wheelbarrow have contributed a\nmiscellaneous and undetermined additional mileage,\nThe toughest travel\nof all is up\ncountry where there are no roads, and the narrow footpath\nwinding through the rice paddies permits only of transportation by\nsedan\nchair or wheelbarrow.\nMy experience with the latter did not last over 100\nyards.\nAfter jolting that far in that springless contraption I decided to\nconcluding that I'd get tired either way,\nand walking offered the\nadvantage of being able to sit down at the end of my journey.\nMy\nwork in China has been largely as an aviation missionary for Pan\nAmerican Airways.\nThe latter company is a partner with\nthe\nChinese Govern-\nment in the\nomership of China -ational Aviation Corporation, the routes\nof which company cover an area almost the size of the United States.\nThe\nC.N.A.C. uses American airplanes flown by American pilots on schedules that\ncall for more than a million airplane miles per annum.\nBeyond attempting\nto keep in touch with the C.N.A.C. my efforts have been directed toward as -\nsisting to work out at this end some of the mechanical and political details\nin connection with the trans-Tacific service.\nI was in Manila when the\nChina Clipper arrived and you can imagine that I got quite a kick out of\nseeing that ship land on the waters of Manila Bay.\nPlease make checks payable to Amherst Alumni Fund",
      "-2-\nI wish that my training in English literature had included a course\nin modern fiction\nso that I\ncould tell you many exciting adventures.\nhave been in cities under martial law which made the headlines in American\npapers but I knew nothing about the situation until said American papers\nreached here sone thirty days later.\nly travels have taken me over\nsection\nwhich according to American press reports were ravished by war,\ncommunists,\nbandits, or floods,\nbut all I could see vere industrious and friendly\nChinese working in the fields.\nPossibly the bandits know that I was for-\nmerly a banker and cleared out before my arrival.\nAn on my way back to Shanghai now in a Douglas D02 which left\nChengtu this morning and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 5 p.m.\nWe are flying 170 miles per house, fourteen passengers mostly Chinese\nplus a four man crew consisting of an American pilot,\nChinese co-pilot,\nand radio operator and steward.\nThe fastest surface transportation between\nShanghai and Chengtu takes 16 days.\nI was glad to find your several letters waiting for me a few days\nago when I returned from Manila - especially the one of March 16th about\nI am hoping that we shall get together somewhere in this part\nof the world.\nIf your Silver Senators would just leave us Chinese alone\nSee you in 138.\nRegards,\nBix\nNote: Since writing the above Mr. Bixby has left for the Philippines.\n******\nThat \"See you in '38\"\nsounds especially good.\nSteamer's fourth\npar graph fooled us the first time we read it\n- of course you got it!\nWe refuse to believe that so nany miles around and over such a country\ncould be as devoid of adventure as he'a have us believe.\nWhen we gather\n\"round that 113 dinner table in '33. I believe it's up to Bix to chip off\nhis shell of modesty and tell us a few tall stories.\nYours for the Alumni Fund,\nDick."
