      "STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL\nOctober 19, 1936\nMr. H.\nVIce President for China,\nPan American Airways Company,\nDM 10/28\n507 Dollar Blag., 51 Canton Rd.,\nShanghai, China.\nDear Mr. Bixby:\nwhich you enclosed original of Permit losued by the Director of\nI have received your letter No. 456,\nof September\nwith\nvices at long Kong, granting P.A.A. the right to operate in Hong Kong\nfor a period of twelve months.\nIt was something of a shock to me to\ndiscover that this permit had been issued to Pan American Airways, Inc.\nbecause,\nof course, trans-Pacific service is operated by Pan American\nAirways\nCompany and all our correspondence with the British with reference\nto Hong Kong rights refers specifically to \"Company.\"\nI can*t imagine\nwhere the Director d\nAir Services ever got the idea of putting in the\nname of Pan American Airways, Inc.\nI immediately cabled you to have this\nchanged and as it is obviously merely a clerical error feel sure you will\nhave no difficulty, but, of course, it leaves us without a valid pernit\nfor that much longer.\nthat it will not interfere with\nAirways Company's plane.\nWith regard to the text of the permit, you call attention to\nthe changed wording in Section 1.\nOf course, this is not nearly so\nsatisfactory as the wording in the letter from the British Air Ministry,\nalthough it would amount to pretty much the same thing if the British\nwished to cancel.\nthere is a good deal of difference between\nan automatic cancellation,\nand a mere right to cancel.\nFor example, if\nthere were some delay in negotiations looking to the extension of\nrights to the British after rights had been granted to some other nation,\npresumably this permit would be invalid during that period, whereas under\nthe former wording this permit could have remained in effect until such\nBritish gave up hope of obtaining the reciprocal rights.\ncannot understand why the Colonial authorities in Hong Kong\nthought it necessary to change the language proposed by their home govern-\nment.\nThe words typed onto the\nend of the pernit \"as circumstances\nmay require\"\nare decidedly vague and the more you think about them the\nless you can understand what they are intended to mean.\nThis again seems\nto have been a contribution by the Hong Kong authorities.\nOn the whole, of course, we feel that there is nothing to do\nbut to accept this permit in its present form and to see what developments\nare during the first year;\nthis, of course, subject to the change in the\nname of the company which is imperative.\nOne reason we do not like the language of Section 1 in the present\npermit is that it makes it appear as though this Company had made a sort of\ntrade and given assurances, if not guarantees, that certain rights would be\nextended to the British and that our rights would be cancelled if we did not",
      "October 19, 1936\nMr. H. M. Bixby, - #2.\nmake good on these guarantees.\nof\ncourse, that is not at all true and it\nshould be obvious to anyone that this Company cannot give any\nassurances\nas to what action the United States Government will take on any given\ndue toch as it were a natest per at tad bee at be senten\nhaving been negotiated, I assume that we cannot be held responsible by\nanyone for the language it contains.\nI have just received your long and very interesting personal\nletter of September 21 discussing a number of confidential\nsubjects.\nlotte to the ile last e\nof course, before you learned that Mr. Trippe was himself\nIt will be a great help to you, I am sure, to have\nthe opportunity to cover these important matters with him personally and\nI shall\ndo.\nbe much interested to learn of his reactions and what you decide to\nI have no comment to make and I am entirely in agreement with all of\nyour observations except that I am a little bit sceptical with regard to\nyour listing as one of\nour assets in CNAC \"our interest in Route 3.\"\nDue to our failure during the last three years to conclude any permanent\nor long term agreement with CNAC covering the operations of Route 3 it woudd\nseem that our interest in Route 3 is wholly dependent upon a temporary\noperating agreement, cancellable by our Chinese friends on 30 days' notice.\nThis seems to be a rather precarious ground for bargain and sale.\nI refer now to your letter of September 26, addressed to Mr. Van\nZandt with regard to the extension of Imperial and K.N.I.L.M. to Manila, in\nwhich you make the suggestion that it would be a good thing if we could\narrange to have the Philippine domestic lines, with our participation,\nmeet the foreign airlines outside the Philippines or possibly you also\nhave in mind meeting the foreign airlines at a port of entry\ncoast of the Philippine Islands.\nWith regard to this plan, I would like to\nsubmit a thought:\nThe establishment of a precedent in the\nunder which foreign international operators would be compelled to turn over\ntheir traffic to Philippine domestic companies at a point just outside the\nPhilippines or on the coast (border) might be very\nembarrassing so far as\nPan American Airways System as a whole is concerned.\nYou can readily see\nthat if this practice were adopted by just a few countries in our Latin\nAmerican field, it might paralize our whole system.\nIt is, in fact,\nour\nNo.\n1 nightmare\nthat someday we may be faced with the demand that our\ninternational\nplanes stop at a frontier and turn over the traffic to a\ndomestic company to carry through that country and turn over in turn to a\ndomestic company of the next country and so on.\nI do not need to elaborate\non this as you can readily think it out for yourself.\nThe mere fact that\nwe participate in the ownership of the domestic company would not improve\nthe situation very much,\nand not at all as regards Washington.\nOf course,\nthe Philippines are not vatin America and it may be that some plan could be\nworked out\nthere which would not\nembarrass us elsewhere, or it may be that\nwe are going to be faced with this difficulty in any case, but the above will\ngive you something to raminate on in your spare time, if\nyou have any, and\nwill also serve as a reminder although none is probably needed,\nthat\nanything we do even in the farthest outpost of the system is liable to\nhave iss serious repercussions elsewhere.\nYours very truly,\nS. F. Morgan.\nSWM : ME\ncci President"
