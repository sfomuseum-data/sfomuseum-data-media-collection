He said he had also been advised by the\nHongkong Government to take off from longkong as\nquickly as possi-\nble.\nHe did not know the reason for either of these two mess-\nages and asked my opinion.\nI told him I could not imagine\nwhat\nwas back of it but considered Hongkong, in case of\ntrouble,\nmore\ndangerous than Manila and suggested he\ndrop his passengers\nand\ntake off.\nAbout five or ten minutes later, he called me again and\ninformed me\nthat he had just been advised\nthat Japan had declared\nwar on Great Britain and America.\nI told him that in that case\nwe would certainly have trouble and that it would be necessary\nto get all the planes out of longkong. I suggested that that even-\nwho knew the country and the lake to accompany him.\nI packed a suitcase as quickly as possible and drove\ninto Hongkong from Repulse Bay at once.\nWhen I\ngot to Hungkong,\nI found the sir raid alarm was on, although I had\nnot heard it.\nMy car was stopped several times by air raid wardens but I insist-\ned on going through and got past them.\nWhen I arrived at the of-\nfice, I tried to get Kaltak Airport over the phone but could not.\nI then decided to go over to Kaltak as quickly as possible.\nwent to Star Ferry and found it was not running because of\nthe\nraid.\nThe regulations during the first day, honday,\napparently\nprohibited anything from moving during air raid periods.\nI. then\nthey also refused to go.\nI ran into a Police Sargeant,\nhe bad to go to Kowloon and suggested to him that we\ngo together,\nbut he said the boats could not go until after the air raid re-\nlease had sounded.\nI suggested that he use his authority to make\ncnego.\nHe said this was against regulations and he might be de-\nmoted.\nI told him I thought that would be an excellent idea and\nleft him.\nI then encountered a Canadian officer and three sold-\nters who were anxious to get to Kowloon.\nWe teamed up\nand they\nforced a sampan to take us over.\ngot over without difficulty.\nThere were no Japanese planes visible during our trip.\ntaxi and went at once to to penna a tea\nI was fortunate enough to get a\nThere I learned\nthat the Clipper had been destroyed.
