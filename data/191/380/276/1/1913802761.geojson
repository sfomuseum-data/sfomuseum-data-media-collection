He said he had also been advised by the\nHongkong Government to take off from longkong as\nquickly as possi-\nble.\nHe did not know the reason for either of these two mess-\nages and asked my opinion.\nI told him I could not imagine\nwhat\nwas back of it but considered Hongkong, in case of\ntrouble,\nmore\ndangerous than Manila and suggested he\ndrop his passengers\nand\ntake off.\nAbout five or ten minutes later, he called me again and\ninformed me\nthat he had just been advised\nthat Japan had declared\nwar on Great Britain and America.\nI told him that in that case\nwe would certainly have trouble and that it would be necessary\nto get all the planes out of longkong. I suggested that that even-\nwho knew the country and the lake to accompany him.\nI packed a suitcase as quickly as possible and drove\ninto Hongkong from Repulse Bay at once.\nWhen I\ngot to Hungkong,\nI found the sir raid alarm was on, although I had\nnot heard it.\nMy car was stopped several times by air raid wardens but I insist-\ned on going through and got past them.\nWhen I arrived at the of-\nfice, I tried to get Kaltak Airport over the phone but could not.\nI then decided to go over to Kaltak as quickly as possible.\nwent to Star Ferry and found it was not running because of\nthe\nraid.\nThe regulations during the first day, honday,\napparently\nprohibited anything from moving during air raid periods.\nI. then\nthey also refused to go.\nI ran into a Police Sargeant,\nhe bad to go to Kowloon and suggested to him that we\ngo together,\nbut he said the boats could not go until after the air raid re-\nlease had sounded.\nI suggested that he use his authority to make\ncnego.\nHe said this was against regulations and he might be de-\nmoted.\nI told him I thought that would be an excellent idea and\nleft him.\nI then encountered a Canadian officer and three sold-\nters who were anxious to get to Kowloon.\nWe teamed up\nand they\nforced a sampan to take us over.\ngot over without difficulty.\nThere were no Japanese planes visible during our trip.\ntaxi and went at once to to penna a tea\nI was fortunate enough to get a\nThere I learned\nthat the Clipper had been destroyed.

Wong also had a list of\nabout 15.\nAt that time, as far as anyone could tell, the conditions\nwere unchanged,\nand I\nsaw no reason to believe that we could not\noperate the\nfollowing night.\nI therefore returned to\nChungking that\nWe continued to get\nword from Namyung\nthat Sweet's\nplane was still having mechanical\ntrouble; in fact,\nwe were informed that one of his engines had burn-\ned out a piston.\nPilot Hugh Chen, about 4 o'clock in the morning,\ntook the\nVultee off\nand flew it to Namyung,\nalthough it had no radio.\nAlso\nhis compass got out of order about halfway to Namyung and he cou-\npleted the trip with a pocket compass.\nNamyung was overcast and\nsince he had no radio he could not let down.\nHe went on beyond, and\nafter daylight he found an opening and came down on a small emergency\nfield. He located himsolf\nand\nthen flew back to Namyung by contact.\nThere he refuelled and continued his flight to Chungking where he\nlanded safely.\nPilot Scott started out about the same time with the remain-\ntoots cotta pit\ncontaining two new G103 engines, one of which we intended\nThe Condor also had no radio.\nHowever,\nScott developed ignition trouble shortly after his take off and re-\nturned to Kaltak.\nThis Condor was\nof those given to Eurasia and\nwhich they had never flown. He got back to Hongkong in time to come\ncut on the last DC-3.\nWhen I arrived in Chungking,\nSharp and Woods and myself bo-\ngan to make plans to send the two DC-3's and one DC-2 that night\n(Wednesday) to Hongkong.\nSharp planned to go back as passenger and\nattempt to take the Concor out with the two\nengines.\nHowever, just\nas we\nhad perfected our arrangements, we received a message from\nMoss instructing us not to return that night, giving no reasons.\nAs there were three people sleeping in every\nroom in the\nplace where I llve and I was by then really\nin need of rest,\nI de-\ncided to go over to the South Bank and spend the night with chugh,\nwho was very cordial and offered me a bed and room to myself. As\nthere was nothing more I could do that day, I went over to the South\nBank and went to bed about 1:30.\nI had been awake for over 53 hours\nand on duty practically the whole time. When I undressed to go to\nbed over\nthere,\nI discovered that I had broken several blood vessels\nin my left leg,\nwalch was badly swollen.\nly foot and ankle were as\nblack as\nyour\nhat and my leg was yellow. I stayed In bed until 8\nthe next morning,\nand felt much better.\nresume service to Hongkong; also considerable criticisms against",
      "- 8 -\nCNAC for not bringing out more Government officials and less CHAC\nstaff.\nMy answer\nto that was that we brought every official that we\nNeprud, who\npersuado officials to come\nor even to the Peninsula Hotel\nwhere we could get them, which is perfectly true.\nExcept for one\nChinese general, who came to Kaitak himself, I do not believe we\nwould have evacuated any unless we had dofinitely made all the ar-\nrangements and got them to the Airport.\nThisk or\ncourse, was due\npartly to the fact that no one expected the situation to\nworsen so\nsidering.\ngot in and out of fongkong with perfoct safety on Wednesday and\nThursday; however, it is hardly fair to say this since I was not\nthere.\nOn\nThursday I called on 51r Archibald Clark Kerr, the Brit-\n1sh Ambassador to China, and he sent a rush message to the Governor\nof Hongkong,\nrequesting permission for ChAC to\ncome in that night.\nLater he got a reply from the Governor authorizing two flights be-\ntween 9 and 12 p.m.\nWe sent further messages to Hongkong requesting\npermission to make more flights the following night but got no reply.\nAt 4 o'clock that afternoon, two of our DC-3's, flown by Pilots\nMcDonaid and Higgs, left Chungking for Hongkong to make the two\nflights authorized. About one hour out of Hongkong they recoived a\nmessage from Moss telling\nthem that arrangements had been cancelled\nand instructing them not to come to Hongkong•\nNo reason was given.\nMcDonald and Higgs then changed their course\nto Namyung, where they\nlanded and picked up members of our staff left there on previous\nflights cut of longkong and returned to Chungking•\nThat was our\nlast effort to get into Hongkong•\nOn\nThursday we got word the Japanese had raided Namyung\nheavily and had repeatedly machine-gunned our DC-3 at low altitudes.\nThe engines were ruined and so were\nthe props.\nMost of the instru-\nments wero shot to pieces, the tires, control lines, hydraulic lines,\nlanding gear and gas tanks.\nVie have\ndismantled it and got it off\nthe field\nseveral miles.\nWe plan to build sneds over the fusilage\nand wings and rebuild it. It will take a long time and we must have\nlots of parts\nfron\nthe States.\nWe can do the rebuilding in five or\nsix months.\nI can't even guess when we can\nget tho\nparts from the\nStates, but one of these days me will have it back in service.\nI would like to say here that I have since criticized my-\nsell severely for leaving Schafer.\nI feel very badly about it, but\nat the time it seemed the best thing to do and there\ndid not seem to\nbe any increased danger.\nSchafer's conduct throughout was splendid.\nHe is a good man and\ncould handle the situation very well.\nI felt\nperfectly satisfied in leaving everything to him, but I am sorry\nnow that I did.\nFor the last three days we have made flights every evening\nto Namyung and back, bringing out supplies which have been evacuated\nout of\nHongkong.\nWe are resuming our schedules to\nthe extent of\nthree times per week from Chungking to Kunming to Lashio and one of\nthese trips\nto Lashio continues to Calcutta.\nWe make our first\nflight to Calcutta on Thursday of this week (December 18th) •\nI plan\nto meet Sir Frederick Tys, Director of Air Civil of India, in\n20191211272d",
