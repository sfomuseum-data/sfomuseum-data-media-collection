Y. Wong also had a list of\nabout 15.\nAt that time, as far as anyone could tell, the conditions\nwere unchanged,\nand I\nsaw no reason to believe that we could not\noperate the\nfollowing night.\nI therefore returned to\nChungking that\nWe continued to get\nword from Namyung\nthat Sweet's\nplane was still having mechanical\ntrouble; in fact,\nwe were informed that one of his engines had burn-\ned out a piston.\nPilot Hugh Chen, about 4 o'clock in the morning,\ntook the\nVultee off\nand flew it to Namyung,\nalthough it had no radio.\nAlso\nhis compass got out of order about halfway to Namyung and he cou-\npleted the trip with a pocket compass.\nNamyung was overcast and\nsince he had no radio he could not let down.\nHe went on beyond, and\nafter daylight he found an opening and came down on a small emergency\nfield. He located himsolf\nand\nthen flew back to Namyung by contact.\nThere he refuelled and continued his flight to Chungking where he\nlanded safely.\nPilot Scott started out about the same time with the remain-\ntoots cotta pit\ncontaining two new G103 engines, one of which we intended\nThe Condor also had no radio.\nHowever,\nScott developed ignition trouble shortly after his take off and re-\nturned to Kaltak.\nThis Condor was\nof those given to Eurasia and\nwhich they had never flown. He got back to Hongkong in time to come\ncut on the last DC-3.\nWhen I arrived in Chungking,\nSharp and Woods and myself bo-\ngan to make plans to send the two DC-3's and one DC-2 that night\n(Wednesday) to Hongkong.\nSharp planned to go back as passenger and\nattempt to take the Concor out with the two\nengines.\nHowever, just\nas we\nhad perfected our arrangements, we received a message from\nMoss instructing us not to return that night, giving no reasons.\nAs there were three people sleeping in every\nroom in the\nplace where I llve and I was by then really\nin need of rest,\nI de-\ncided to go over to the South Bank and spend the night with chugh,\nwho was very cordial and offered me a bed and room to myself. As\nthere was nothing more I could do that day, I went over to the South\nBank and went to bed about 1:30.\nI had been awake for over 53 hours\nand on duty practically the whole time. When I undressed to go to\nbed over\nthere,\nI discovered that I had broken several blood vessels\nin my left leg,\nwalch was badly swollen.\nly foot and ankle were as\nblack as\nyour\nhat and my leg was yellow. I stayed In bed until 8\nthe next morning,\nand felt much better.\nresume service to Hongkong; also considerable criticisms against",
