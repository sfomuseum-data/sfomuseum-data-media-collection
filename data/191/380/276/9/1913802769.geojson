About one hour out of Hongkong they recoived a\nmessage from Moss telling\nthem that arrangements had been cancelled\nand instructing them not to come to Hongkong•\nNo reason was given.\nMcDonald and Higgs then changed their course\nto Namyung, where they\nlanded and picked up members of our staff left there on previous\nflights cut of longkong and returned to Chungking•\nThat was our\nlast effort to get into Hongkong•\nOn\nThursday we got word the Japanese had raided Namyung\nheavily and had repeatedly machine-gunned our DC-3 at low altitudes.\nThe engines were ruined and so were\nthe props.\nMost of the instru-\nments wero shot to pieces, the tires, control lines, hydraulic lines,\nlanding gear and gas tanks.\nVie have\ndismantled it and got it off\nthe field\nseveral miles.\nWe plan to build sneds over the fusilage\nand wings and rebuild it. It will take a long time and we must have\nlots of parts\nfron\nthe States.\nWe can do the rebuilding in five or\nsix months.\nI can't even guess when we can\nget tho\nparts from the\nStates, but one of these days me will have it back in service.\nI would like to say here that I have since criticized my-\nsell severely for leaving Schafer.\nI feel very badly about it, but\nat the time it seemed the best thing to do and there\ndid not seem to\nbe any increased danger.\nSchafer's conduct throughout was splendid.\nHe is a good man and\ncould handle the situation very well.\nI felt\nperfectly satisfied in leaving everything to him, but I am sorry\nnow that I did.\nFor the last three days we have made flights every evening\nto Namyung and back, bringing out supplies which have been evacuated\nout of\nHongkong.\nWe are resuming our schedules to\nthe extent of\nthree times per week from Chungking to Kunming to Lashio and one of\nthese trips\nto Lashio continues to Calcutta.\nWe make our first\nflight to Calcutta on Thursday of this week (December 18th) •\nI plan\nto meet Sir Frederick Tys, Director of Air Civil of India, in\n20191211272d",
