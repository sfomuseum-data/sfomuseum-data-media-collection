CAL.\nJuly 18, 1949\nDear Debby:\nHow very sweet you were to send me the\nLovely, little white bag by Harold, and I\nthank\nyou far more than I can say.\nIt is some-\nthing I need and will use it with\nthe greatest\npleasure.\nI was so terribly disappointed that I\ndidn't see Harold and Bondie when they were\nhere. We talked over the telephone as perhaps\nhave a nice telephone visit however, and I\nheard all about the wonderful children and\ngrandchildren.\nLife goes on for us here in the same busy\nquite a long time, isn't it?\nAs you know, we had a visit\nfrom \"Slim\"\nlast winter.\nI always enjoy seeing him and I\nthought this time he looked better than before.\nHis mother evidently is an invalid now from\nwhat I gathered.\nHaven't heard from Elma Stevenot in some\ntime but I believe that she has moved to San\nFrancisco. I was told that one daughter's\nmarriage had been very unhappy which I am\nsure must distress Elma terribly.",
