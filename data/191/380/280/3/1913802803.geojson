It sounds ideal\nto me.\nI think\nthat\nI have always\nbeen a traveler at heart.\nI was sorry\nthat Harold didn't come out to the Far\nEast\nin September with the group that made the trip\non the Stratocruiser.\nI am always glad to see Bondie,\nof course, but it wasn't until the group walked in\nfor the luncheon that day that I realized that Harold\nhad not come but Bondie had come in his place.\nYou spoke of Elma Stevenot -- I haven't heard from\nher now in nearly a year.\nEach Christmas\nI get a\nlittle note from her.\nI had heard that one of the girls\nhad had an unhappy marriage\nand at the time Elma\nwrote me about it and how distressed she was.\nEvidently\nthe other girl though has worked her life out better.\nLike you I admire Elma very much, and we were\ncertainly\ndevoted to Joe.\nHe got so much out of life and\ngave\n50 mentha\nand I will never forget how shocked\nI was at\nI had talked to him the day that he flew\nfrom Australia.\nHe dropped in to see me.\nAs you know,\nwe had Slim out here nearly a year ago.\nI gathered\nfrom what he said that his mother must be really ter-\nribly ill.\nHe said she still lived in the same house\nin Detroit and that her brother was still living,\nwhich is very fortunate.\nI know you miss your grandchildren, but it is\nnice\nthat you can still have one member\nof the family\nwith you - your youngest.\nI hope in every way all\nyour happy plans for this winter work out, and I do\nhope\nthat some\nday\nour paths may cross again as it\nwould be so wonderful to see you and talk with you.\nLove to you and yours,\nDevotedly,",
