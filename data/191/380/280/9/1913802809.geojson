Bixby,\n51 Canton Road,\nShanghai, China.\nDear Mrs. Bixby:\nI\nwas delighted to get your letter today\nand to know that you had received the envelopes\nand my\nletters.\nI\nan afraid that I'm giving you all a lot of\nbother and certainly those covers are a nuisance,\nand I\noften tell myself that I'm through with them but\nthey\nare\nsort of fascinating too and the thought and\ntime\nI waste on\nthem does seem to rest me when I'm tired from worrying over\nmore weighty matters.\nIt will\nbe sort of\na relief\nflight is to take place\nand\nwhen we know when the first\nwhere the China\nterminus is to\nbe, but I suppose that wheels within wheels revolve slowly -\nin any case I've sort of sprinkled my covers all\nover the\nmay and hope you will not have too much difficulty in hand-\nling them.\nI'm sorry the unofficial flight to Hong Kong did not carry mail.\nI had some covers made for that flight printed from linoleum\nblocks in\nthree colors that I\nI'11 have a chance to use them later.\nthought interesting - possibly\nI am enclosing these pictures clipped from envelopes\nas well\nas some that I have had made for the Eucharistic Congress\nstamy issue.\nI am\nalso\nenclosing\ntwo\ncovers of the first pay passenger\nflight - hope you like them.\nWe have been here a month now and find the time passing very\nfast.\nWe have spent most\nof it with our daughter who has just\nhad her second son, Whipple Hall Manning, and of course we are\nall very happy and proud as can be.\nMrs. Hall joins me in kindest regards to you all.\nYours very sincerely,\n244 Lakeside Drive,\nOakland, Califomia.",
