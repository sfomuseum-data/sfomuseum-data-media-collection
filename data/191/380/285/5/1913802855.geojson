Richards soon after I return to the United States,\nalso talk to him about it.\nI agree fully that it would\nbe a tragedy to have those wonderful islands spoihed through\nexcessive development.\nMr. Thomas W. Richards\nNature Conservancy\nWashington, D.C.\nThanks a great deal for the invitation to visit.\nI would love to see you,\nand also to\ncome to Captiva\nwish I could\nsay we would hop on a plane and come right down; but\nthat is simply impossible for me at this time.\nBest to you always, in which I know Anne joins me,",
