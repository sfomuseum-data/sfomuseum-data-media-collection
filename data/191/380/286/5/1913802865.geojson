      "Switzerland\nAug. 17, 1969\nDear Mr. Leary:\nMy apology for the lateness of this reply to your June 30th\nletter.\nI have\nbeen\ntravelling almost constantly, and an\nhopelessly behind with correspondence.\nI regard Harold Bixby as one of the great men I have known,\nboth in relation to his ability and to his personal character.\nIn this respect, my experience has been similar to yours: I\nhave never met anyone who kanw him who did not have the greatest\nrespect and admiration for him.\nYou ask what personal\nqualities Mr. Bixby\npossessed.\nI can\nmention a few,\nbut they will be no more than indicative of the\nto tal.\nHe had a face and a snile you trusted from the moment\nyou saw him, and the more you saw of him, the more he confirmed\nyour trust.\nyour true and a wonder and or eaty. And ne he fundamental\nBixby forsaw a future in aviation and, typically, he imple-\nmented his vision by taking an active part in its development.\nI can not tell you when his activities in aviation began; but\nthey were underway when I first flew into Lambert Field, at\nSt. Louis, in I923.\nBixby bought one of the first (if not the firet) Travelair\nbiplanes that was more than a reconditioned World War I trainer,\nand he learned to fly it.\nAs you know, he was one of the major\nbackers of my flight to paris in the \"Spirit of St. Louls.\"\nHe flew with me on a number of occasions, some of\nconnection\nwith the organization of \"Transcontinental Air\nTransport,\" in which he took an active part.\nLater, he joined Pan American Airways, and quickly came\nto be regarded as one of the company's ablest\nofficers.\nIn\nthis position, he took charge of pan American's interests in\nChina and, with his family, lived in that country for some\nyears.\nAs you know, he was outstandingly successful in this\neffort.\nBixby was fascinated with China.\nI am under the impression\nthat he regarded his years in\nthe Orient as among the most\nenjoyable and worthwhile of his life.\nI believe that in my previous letter I referred you to Mrs.\nBixby as a\nsource of more detailed information.\nHer address is:\nMrs. Harold i.
