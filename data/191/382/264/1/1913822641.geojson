More of that later.\nHe have the opportunity\nas will be shown.\nThe Chinese Communiats promised land reforms. The New York FORLD TELEGRAM\nAND SUN of April 12th had this to say:\n\"Red Chine's\n\"land reform\" has developed into a vicious\ncountryside wer in many areas,\nwith both landlords and\nRed cadres sent out to divide up the fams.\nIn some\nsections the army has had to be called out.\nChairmen Liu Shao-chi admits \"agrarian reform is a\nflerce struggle,\" but is going ahesd in East, South-\nCentral and Northwest China.\"\nThe above dispatch is interesting in the light of a report by Winston\nChurchill in his fourth book, \"The Hinge of Fate\" in which he relates a conference\nwith Stalin as follows:\n\"Tell ne,\" I asked, \"have the stresses of this war been as bad to you\npersonally as carrying through the polley of the Collective Farms?\"\n-... â€¢\n\"Oh, no,\" he said, \"the Collective Fern policy was a terrible atruggle.\"\n\"I thought you would have found it bed,\" said I, \"becuse you were not\ndeling with a few score thousends of aristocrats or big landowners, but with\nmillions of small men.*\n\"Ten millions,\" he said, holding up his hands.\n\"It was fearful.\nFour\nyears it lasted.\nIt was absolutely necessary for fussia, if we were to avoid\nperiodie famines, to plough the land with tractors. He must mechanize our agri-\nculture.\nThen we gave tractors to the pessants they were sll spoiled in a few\nmon tha.\nOnly Collective Farms with Workshops could handle tractors. We took\nthe grestest trouble to explain it to the pessents.\nIt was no use arguing with\nthen.\nAfter you have said all you can to a persent he says he must go home and\nconsult his wife, and he must consult his herder.*\n....*After he has talked it\nover with them he always answers that he does not want the Collective Ferm and he\n-\n1 -",
