This neans another large ineresse in the food\nsupply.\"\nIt is interesting to note how closely the Russian-treined Chinese Com-\nmunists are following the Moscow pettern.\nThose who rule China today from Peking\nmay well apply the Russian program to the grent plain country of northern Chine\nwere agriculture is largely the production of grain and the same collective\nferns with nechanized euipment may be successfully operated.\nHowever, the\neconomy of southern and western Chins is largely tied to the cultivation of rice.\nGenerally speaking,\nthe rice paddy is necessarily a amall tract of\nground which\ndoes not lend itself to mechanised production.\nFurthermore, the Chinese people,\nwho differ from other\npeoples in so many respects, have one outstanding difference -\nthe people of the north are the lazy, indolent ones while the people of the south\nhave all the spirit and progressiveness. They are not docile as those of the\nnorth.\nIf we are going to do something about China it should be done quickly.\nThe Chinese individusl known to the Old China Hand was on the averge a hardworking,\ngood-humored citizen who had been taught from erliest childhood\nto respect and\nrevere his elders,\nto preotice the virtuea me most admire, of humility, modesty,\ntolerance.\nThe average\nChinese possessed these qualities\nplus a fine sense of\nresponsibility, \u0026 willingness to work hard from dawn to dusk.\nHe thought of\nhimself first,\nof his fanily second, of the little town that he came from third\nand of the State\n83\nvery\nbed fourth.\nNow the children are being taken away\nfrom the parents and the old virtues are diving my to a systen of instruction\ncalculated to\nproduce a\nchurlish fellow who has none of the old virtues but rather\nis taught\nthit the State comes first, and thit he should forget his little tom,\nhis family and himself.\nHe is teught that China was a cultured netion when we\nforeigners\nwere still\nseveges.\nIf the Communist doctrines are taught to the younger\ngeneration for fifteen years there will be no more China as we knew it but an\nentirely different\nrace of people with\nwhom we or our children shell have to deal.\nTherefore it is important that if Chine is to be returned to the company of free\nnations we should\ndo something about it and soon.\nThe Chinese, particularly those of the south and west, have an intense\nlove of the good erth.\nTrue, that is almost a biological urge but the Chinese\npossess it\nto a marked degree.\nThe Chinese peasant wenta to own s piece of land\nwhich he\ncan improve and\npass on to his children.\nHe wants no part of a systen\nof collectivized farms.\nThat is where our systen of private ownership of land hes\nite greatest\nHe will\ngo to almost any length to acquire\nbut nder\nthe old\nsystem of Chiang Kai-shek and his corrupt regime the small landomers lived\n2 -",
