      "MaY 25, 1951\nart\nIt wes a hopelessly corrupt and inept government which\nspawned the\nChinese Communists.\nThe people of China yearned for sone decent Leadership, any\nleadership other then whet they had.\nThey did not turn to Communism.\nThey\nturned\nfrom\nthe Kuoninteng.\nThe unplessent truth is th t the Communiats have brought\nsomething new\nto Chine.\nIt serves no useful purpose merely to condemn the Reds.\nIt is\nbetter,\nrather, to analyze their strength and look for some means of competing.\nMost of those\nwho have lately returned from Connunist China admit that there exists\na new order of honesty.\nSoldiers are well disciplined and they fight with a new\nspirit.\nThe Communists have wrought some truly grest changes.\nTraina run on time.\nThey do not wait for some arrogent official uno is deliberately late in order to\nkeep the train weiting and then strut down the platform so that all enn see the big\nshot for whom the train and ell its pessengers have been inconvenienced.\nPorters\nrefuse tips.\nSo\ndo dining car miters.\nGenerals and publie officials cun't be\nbought.\nThis is no brief for Chinese or any other kind of Conuunism but if we are\nto defeat them we must recognize their strength as well or even better than their\nweakness and\ndo something about it. More of that later.\nHe have the opportunity\nas will be shown.\nThe Chinese Communiats promised land reforms. The New York FORLD TELEGRAM\nAND SUN of April 12th had this to say:\n\"Red Chine's\n\"land reform\" has developed into a vicious\ncountryside wer in many areas,\nwith both landlords and\nRed cadres sent out to divide up the fams.\nIn some\nsections the army has had to be called out.\nChairmen Liu Shao-chi admits \"agrarian reform is a\nflerce struggle,\" but is going ahesd in East, South-\nCentral and Northwest China.\"\nThe above dispatch is interesting in the light of a report by Winston\nChurchill in his fourth book, \"The Hinge of Fate\" in which he relates a conference\nwith Stalin as follows:\n\"Tell ne,\" I asked, \"have the stresses of this war been as bad to you\npersonally as carrying through the polley of the Collective Farms?\"\n-... â€¢\n\"Oh, no,\" he said, \"the Collective Fern policy was a terrible atruggle.\"\n\"I thought you would have found it bed,\" said I, \"becuse you were not\ndeling with a few score thousends of aristocrats or big landowners, but with\nmillions of small men.*\n\"Ten millions,\" he said, holding up his hands.\n\"It was fearful.\nFour\nyears it lasted.\nIt was absolutely necessary for fussia, if we were to avoid\nperiodie famines, to plough the land with tractors. He must mechanize our agri-\nculture.\nThen we gave tractors to the pessants they were sll spoiled in a few\nmon tha.\nOnly Collective Farms with Workshops could handle tractors. We took\nthe grestest trouble to explain it to the pessents.\nIt was no use arguing with\nthen.\nAfter you have said all you can to a persent he says he must go home and\nconsult his wife, and he must consult his herder.*\n....*After he has talked it\nover with them he always answers that he does not want the Collective Ferm and he\n-\n1 -",
      "would rather do without the tractors.\"\n*What happened?\" I asked.\n\"Oh, well,\" he said, \"many of then agreed to come in with us.\nSome of\nthen were given land of their own to cultivate in the province of Tomsk or the\nprovince of Irkutsk or farther north, but the great bulk were very unpopular und\nwere wiped out by their laborers.\"\n*There was a considerable pease.\nThen, \"Not only have we vastly in-\ncreased the food supply, but we have improved the quality of the grain beyond \u002611\nnessure.\nA11 kinds of\ngrain used to be grown.\nNow no one is allowed to sow any\nbut the standard Soviet grain from one and of our country to the other.\nIf they\ndo they\nare severely desit with. This neans another large ineresse in the food\nsupply.\"\nIt is interesting to note how closely the Russian-treined Chinese Com-\nmunists are following the Moscow pettern.\nThose who rule China today from Peking\nmay well apply the Russian program to the grent plain country of northern Chine\nwere agriculture is largely the production of grain and the same collective\nferns with nechanized euipment may be successfully operated.\nHowever, the\neconomy of southern and western Chins is largely tied to the cultivation of rice.\nGenerally speaking,\nthe rice paddy is necessarily a amall tract of\nground which\ndoes not lend itself to mechanised production.\nFurthermore, the Chinese people,\nwho differ from other\npeoples in so many respects, have one outstanding difference -\nthe people of the north are the lazy, indolent ones while the people of the south\nhave all the spirit and progressiveness. They are not docile as those of the\nnorth.\nIf we are going to do something about China it should be done quickly.\nThe Chinese individusl known to the Old China Hand was on the averge a hardworking,\ngood-humored citizen who had been taught from erliest childhood\nto respect and\nrevere his elders,\nto preotice the virtuea me most admire, of humility, modesty,\ntolerance.\nThe average\nChinese possessed these qualities\nplus a fine sense of\nresponsibility, \u0026 willingness to work hard from dawn to dusk.\nHe thought of\nhimself first,\nof his fanily second, of the little town that he came from third\nand of the State\n83\nvery\nbed fourth.\nNow the children are being taken away\nfrom the parents and the old virtues are diving my to a systen of instruction\ncalculated to\nproduce a\nchurlish fellow who has none of the old virtues but rather\nis taught\nthit the State comes first, and thit he should forget his little tom,\nhis family and himself.\nHe is teught that China was a cultured netion when we\nforeigners\nwere still\nseveges.\nIf the Communist doctrines are taught to the younger\ngeneration for fifteen years there will be no more China as we knew it but an\nentirely different\nrace of people with\nwhom we or our children shell have to deal.\nTherefore it is important that if Chine is to be returned to the company of free\nnations we should\ndo something about it and soon.\nThe Chinese, particularly those of the south and west, have an intense\nlove of the good erth.\nTrue, that is almost a biological urge but the Chinese\npossess it\nto a marked degree.\nThe Chinese peasant wenta to own s piece of land\nwhich he\ncan improve and\npass on to his children.\nHe wants no part of a systen\nof collectivized farms.\nThat is where our systen of private ownership of land hes\nite greatest\nHe will\ngo to almost any length to acquire\nbut nder\nthe old\nsystem of Chiang Kai-shek and his corrupt regime the small landomers lived\n2 -",
      "perpetuslly on the brink of bankruptey brought and held thare by\ntaxes of every\nenceivable type,\noften paid years in advince and used not for\nthe development\nof the countrycide, education or publie worka but rather to support corrupt gov-\nernment officials and their aries.\nIf we are to do anything about fomenting an\nuprising in the south and weatern\nChina (and we should - soon) it will have to\nbe based upon the promise of land\nreforms and honest administration.\nWe should\ngive our support only to those who are willing to dedicate themselves unequi-\nvocally to that commitment.\nThe successful lesdership\nof any\nrevolution in\nsouthern or western Chins must be under sodeone other than Chiang Kei-shek.\nThe\nGene aliasino is honest but he has almys permitted his henchmen to\nengege in\nevery type of corruption.\nThose recently returned from Chine report that there\nare fer if any Chinese even anong those who face the purge who would welcome\nChiang Kal-shek back to the meinland.\nHowever,\n80 far as Chiang 1a\nconcerned\nhe la in control of Formosa and must be dealt with.\nWhile this would not have\nbeen possible in the pest it would be possible today to put a man in Ching Kai-\nshek's orgenization very\nmuch as the benka put a work-out\"\nman into an organization\nwhich is in finanoial difficulty.\nSuch a man should lave a military beckground\nin order that he might understand all of the military implie tions, the possibilities\nand the probabilities.\nHe should be a strong man with a\npassion for anonynity\nrether than publieity.\nHe should be willing to\n\"ait in\nthe beck room and direct\nwith a minimun of\npublicity and ae speeches.\nHe would compel\nChiang Kai-shei to\neppoint lenders of integrity and ability to proceed to the mainland\nfor the or-\nganisation of many counter-revolutions in south and western China.\nThese men\nmust be given the\nassurance and in some way guarented three besie principles in\norder to secure support:\n(2)\nLind reforms with the promise of ressonable taxes\nfor local improvementa,\nanitation, aids to sgriculture; (2)\nof land under these lend reforms,\nand (3)\nThe introduetion\npaDer currencT.\nThe experience of Chinese with paper noney has never been good\nbut since\nthe war the average Chinese is more than ever convinced that paper\nmoney - no piper money - is any good.\nHe will avidly exchange a hatful of paper\nmoney\nfor one\nsilver dollar.\nPromises, 1f made by responsible lesders, backed by\narmed forces with ailver dollars to buy rather than commandeer would unleash long\npent-up forces among the Chinese of south and western Chine, of such strength as\nto overwhelm and\noverthrow the Communiat Goverment in those aress.\nThese leaders\nshould be supported fron the fortreas of Fornoss by surface shipping and a well\norganized airlift such as enabled Ten Hsi-shen to hold off the Communiats at Tel\nYun for months, when he ma entirely surrounded.\nThere are today\nhonest and sincere Chinese leaders in Hongkong and Formoss\ncould relly substantil aupport anong the people of western and southern China\nbut they are unwilling\nto undertake such a program because they know that if they\nwere successful Chiang Kal-shek himself would depose then.\nThey must be given\nsatisfactory assurances that no such course will be follored.\nIn order te give sueh men the backing of the Formosa Government our\nrepresentetive \"in the back room\" should be fully supported by the Anerdeen Govera-\nroment with the British end French that no help\nwhatsoever would be extended to Chiang Kai-shek except through our representative\nand his staff so that Ching Kal-shek would know one and for all that he could\nnot play one goverment against the other and that he would continue to get\nsupport and sid fron abroad, especially ailver, only and solely through the recon-\nmendations of the American representative.",
      "*General liedemeyer has denonstrated extraordinary capabilities an well\nas a remarkable ability to keep out of the heudlines and avoid personal\npublicity.\nHe has spent a greet deal of time in Chins and has the complete confidence and\nrespect of Chiang Kei-shek as well as other Chinese leaders. He would be an\nides man for the post above mentioned.\nFor miny years Ching Kal-shek with a large aray, air force and some naval\nforces wes uneble to exterminate a determined but small force of Communists in\nKiongsi Province.\nEventually in 1935 the Communists were driven out of Kiangsi\nmore by economie blockades, the need of selt and other busie foodstuffs, than any\n111 tary success.\nIn the reverse of that episode, it will be clear that any well-\nJed, well-equipped, deterined group of Chinese patriots with the assistance of\nairborne supplies would be able to stand off any Red forces that could be thrown\nagainst them.\nEspecially is this true because of the feet that the grent messes\nof Chinese people would be sympathetie to such a rebellion and would lend every\npossible aid to protect rather than expose the members of such an organization.\nFurthermore, the American support of auch a group of groups would be well received\nin Chine.\nIt will take the Communists many years of propaganda to offuet the\nenormous\npopularity of Americs and American institutions throughout Chine.\nMay 25, 1951\n*(This wus written before General Redemeyer resigned from the Army.)"
