    "media:imagetext": "*General liedemeyer has denonstrated extraordinary capabilities an well\nas a remarkable ability to keep out of the heudlines and avoid personal\npublicity.\nHe has spent a greet deal of time in Chins and has the complete confidence and\nrespect of Chiang Kei-shek as well as other Chinese leaders. He would be an\nides man for the post above mentioned.\nFor miny years Ching Kal-shek with a large aray, air force and some naval\nforces wes uneble to exterminate a determined but small force of Communists in\nKiongsi Province.\nEventually in 1935 the Communists were driven out of Kiangsi\nmore by economie blockades, the need of selt and other busie foodstuffs, than any\n111 tary success.\nIn the reverse of that episode, it will be clear that any well-\nJed, well-equipped, deterined group of Chinese patriots with the assistance of\nairborne supplies would be able to stand off any Red forces that could be thrown\nagainst them.\nEspecially is this true because of the feet that the grent messes\nof Chinese people would be sympathetie to such a rebellion and would lend every\npossible aid to protect rather than expose the members of such an organization.\nFurthermore, the American support of auch a group of groups would be well received\nin Chine.\nIt will take the Communists many years of propaganda to offuet the\nenormous\npopularity of Americs and American institutions throughout Chine.\nMay 25, 1951\n*(This wus written before General Redemeyer resigned from the Army.)",
