    "media:imagetext": "5/5/58\nBack in 1926 I had an idea that the railroads should be in the\ntransportation business in all phases. That air travel was coming and\ncould\nbe well employed by the railroads to clear their tracks of money-losing\npassenger trains in favor of dividend-earning freight. No new rail lines\ncould be built between, for instance, New York and St. Louis. The expense\nof obtaining right-of-way and\nconstruction would be fantastic.\nTherefore,\nthe railroads could meet the increased demand for fast freight only through\nclearing their tracks. I talked this idea over with Father and he suggested\nthat I see his old friend, Alfred H. Smith, President of the New York Central.\nI went to New York with a letter of introduction from Father. Mr.\nSmith could not have been more courteous. He listened attentively to my\nstory and\ngave me\nthe\nchance to develop my argument fully. I pointed out\nthat a recent study by the Interstate Commerce Commission showed that 30%\nof the time of freight trains and crews in a typical operation was taken up\nwaiting on sidetracks for passenger trains to pass. I said that the time\nwould come when the New York Central would say to a prospective passenger,\n\"We have a passenger train which will take you from New York to St. Louis\nin thirty hours. It will be sidetracked along the way so that the fast\nfreight trains may roll by it. BUT, we have an air service which will take\nyou from New York to St. Louis in three hours.\" I then said that for the\npresent the passenger trains should provide night travel (for in those days,\n\"fly by night\"\nwas a term applied to people considered a little off the\nbeam) across the Alleghenys - then known as \"the pilot\"s graveyard\" - with\na change to airplanes for daytime travel over the mid-west flat terrain.\nWhen I had presented all my arguments, Mr. Smith leaned back in\nhis chair and said: \"Young man, the New York Central is not and never will",
