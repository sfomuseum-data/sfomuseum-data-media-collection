Bixby, would be so visionary as to believe that anyone would\never travel as a passenger in an airplane.\"\nAfter Lindbergh's 1927 goodwill flight around Central America in the\n\"Spirit of St. Louis\", he suggested that we work on my idea of a train by night\nand fly by day. We did not see Mr. Smith but rather talked to General Atterbury,\nPresident of the Pennsylvania, who approved the plan, and as a result there\nwas organized Transcontinental Air Transport. The Pennsylvania provided\novernight service from New York to Columbus, Ohio where the traveler transferred\nto a good old tri-motor Ford for the daylight run, and switched to the Atchison,\nTopeka and Santa Fe for the second night's run into Los Angel√©s, cutting the\ntranscontinental train time in two. TAT, unfortunately, is now TWA.\nGeneral Atterbury said, \"Of course, neither you nor I will ever fly\nto St. Louis in three hours, but we may in eight.\" (My last flight to St.\nLouis took two hours and fifty-five minutes! The jets will make it in an\nhour and a half.)\nThinking back to my conversation with Mr. Smith of over thirty years\nago, you can imagine that I smiled when I read the following in TIME of May\n5, 1958:\n\"THE\nELEGANCE\nDEPARTS\"\n\"In the great age of railroads, one of the symbols of elegance\nwas the New York Central's Twentieth Century Limited. In the\nlast 56 years, the Twentieth Century acquired such features as\nbarbershops, valets, showers, radiotelephone service, gift\ncorsages, earned about $200 million as the most luxurious",
