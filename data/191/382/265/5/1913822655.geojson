      "5/5/58\nBack in 1926 I had an idea that the railroads should be in the\ntransportation business in all phases. That air travel was coming and\ncould\nbe well employed by the railroads to clear their tracks of money-losing\npassenger trains in favor of dividend-earning freight. No new rail lines\ncould be built between, for instance, New York and St. Louis. The expense\nof obtaining right-of-way and\nconstruction would be fantastic.\nTherefore,\nthe railroads could meet the increased demand for fast freight only through\nclearing their tracks. I talked this idea over with Father and he suggested\nthat I see his old friend, Alfred H. Smith, President of the New York Central.\nI went to New York with a letter of introduction from Father. Mr.\nSmith could not have been more courteous. He listened attentively to my\nstory and\ngave me\nthe\nchance to develop my argument fully. I pointed out\nthat a recent study by the Interstate Commerce Commission showed that 30%\nof the time of freight trains and crews in a typical operation was taken up\nwaiting on sidetracks for passenger trains to pass. I said that the time\nwould come when the New York Central would say to a prospective passenger,\n\"We have a passenger train which will take you from New York to St. Louis\nin thirty hours. It will be sidetracked along the way so that the fast\nfreight trains may roll by it. BUT, we have an air service which will take\nyou from New York to St. Louis in three hours.\" I then said that for the\npresent the passenger trains should provide night travel (for in those days,\n\"fly by night\"\nwas a term applied to people considered a little off the\nbeam) across the Alleghenys - then known as \"the pilot\"s graveyard\" - with\na change to airplanes for daytime travel over the mid-west flat terrain.\nWhen I had presented all my arguments, Mr. Smith leaned back in\nhis chair and said: \"Young man, the New York Central is not and never will",
      "Page two\nbe interested in any such crazy scheme. I am surprised that a son of my\nold friend, W. K. Bixby, would be so visionary as to believe that anyone would\never travel as a passenger in an airplane.\"\nAfter Lindbergh's 1927 goodwill flight around Central America in the\n\"Spirit of St. Louis\", he suggested that we work on my idea of a train by night\nand fly by day. We did not see Mr. Smith but rather talked to General Atterbury,\nPresident of the Pennsylvania, who approved the plan, and as a result there\nwas organized Transcontinental Air Transport. The Pennsylvania provided\novernight service from New York to Columbus, Ohio where the traveler transferred\nto a good old tri-motor Ford for the daylight run, and switched to the Atchison,\nTopeka and Santa Fe for the second night's run into Los Angelés, cutting the\ntranscontinental train time in two. TAT, unfortunately, is now TWA.\nGeneral Atterbury said, \"Of course, neither you nor I will ever fly\nto St. Louis in three hours, but we may in eight.\" (My last flight to St.\nLouis took two hours and fifty-five minutes! The jets will make it in an\nhour and a half.)\nThinking back to my conversation with Mr. Smith of over thirty years\nago, you can imagine that I smiled when I read the following in TIME of May\n5, 1958:\n\"THE\nELEGANCE\nDEPARTS\"\n\"In the great age of railroads, one of the symbols of elegance\nwas the New York Central's Twentieth Century Limited. In the\nlast 56 years, the Twentieth Century acquired such features as\nbarbershops, valets, showers, radiotelephone service, gift\ncorsages, earned about $200 million as the most luxurious",
      "Page three\nway of traveling between New York and Chicago. At its\npopular peak, the train ran seven sections.\nBut the\nCentury's patrons have been gradually defecting to the\nairlines. The passengers dwindled from hundreds to as few\nas 75 recently, and the Central has lost $1.50 for every\n$5. it took in.\nThis week the Central stripped the\nCentury of luxury features, combined it with the Commodore\nVanderbilt, added day coaches, made it just another train \"for\nthe summer\". But railroaders guessed it would be permanent. \"\nWith all due respect to General Atterbury's favorable attitude toward\nthe project, it is distinctly an understatement to say that the support of\nCharles A. Lindbergh was a whole lot different than my original approach to\nMr. Smith.\nAfter participation by the Pennsylvania, our Government policy pro-\nhibited the ownership of air transport undertakings by surface carriers, with\nthe result that the railroad was compelled to divest itself of its TAT\nholdings. The wisdom of that decision at the Government level remains to be\ndetermined. Perhaps if the railroads had been permitted to go full out for\nair travel they would today be making good profits instead of losses on pas-\nsenger business and giving better freight service with increased earnings."
