      "Hong Koy 10/6/37\nInterviewed today relative to the present status of China National\nAviation Corporation, and with regard to the recent attachment by the\nTexaco Company of the CNAC Douglas Transport now at Kai Tak, Mr. P. Y.\nWong, Business Manager of the organization, made the following statements:\n\"It is regrettable that the action of the Texaco Company in attach-\ning our Douglas Transport should have taken place as it did, as we have\nfor the past six years dealt with their organization in the purchase of\nfuel for our aircraft. Such purchases have in the past amounted to sev-\neral hundred thousand dollars every year, and all accounts have been\nsettled promptly and to their satisfaction.\n\"The recent hasty action of the Texaco Company in impounding our\nplane on September 24 revealed the fact that on September 23, the day\nprevious, $33,000 of the $60,000 account due Texaco had been paid to\ntheir representative at Hankow, and that special arrangement with the\nChinese Government to release\nour deposits, or at least permit us to\nloan on our deposits, had been granted. The short period of delinquency\nof our account had previously been due to the fact that Government regula-\ntions did not permit us to draw on our deposits in Chinese banks in order\nto meet our obligations promptly, as we have always done in the past.\n\"CNAC not only has sufficient cash to pay off all obligations, but\nalso to purchase new plane nine parts, and that, precisoly, has\nbeen the purpose of my visit to Hong Kong at this time. In addition, we\nhave not only been able to maintain regular daily schedules on our\nYangtze River line, between Nanking and Chungking, but are also planning\nto inaugurate new lines in order to provide better communications by air\nbetween\ncoastal ports and the interior. CNAC is operating our line purely\nas a common carrier, in order to maintain our status quo in the\nOriental\ncommercial aviation field.\"\nC NAC\nwil\ncontmue ti\nперіст\nPa\nапи\nas\nди\nmeral\nout.\nand the Republi\nan way\nCharmi"
