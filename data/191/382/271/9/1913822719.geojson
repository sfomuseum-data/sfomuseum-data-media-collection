    "media:imagetext": "ent because the Minister of\nCommunications seldom held office for more\nthan a\nfew years and each new appointee wanted to have his own team.\nThe company did not receive any\nsubsidy from the Chinese Government.\nIts only revenue came from the\ncarriage of passengers and airmail\nwhich was carried under a unique and most satisfactory arrangement.\nIf a letter was sent by ordinary mail the sender put on a five cent\nstamp and from\nthat revenue the Post Office had to\npay for rail or\nboat transportation.\nIf the letter was sent airmail the sender added\nto the five cent\nstamp whatever the airmail postage cost and\nthis entire\nsurcharge went to the airline. So that the premiun for airmail service\nwent to\nthe company which provided the expedited service while the\nPost Office retained the five cents to cover local pickup and delivery.\nEvery six months the Post Office, with representatives of the airline\npresent, counted the number of units of mail\nper kilo (2.2 lbs) and\nthat became the basis of payment by the Post Office to the airline for\nthe next\nsix months. The unit of mail was 20 grams and\nthe airmail\nsur-\ncharge was 25 cents so that if each letter had\nweighed\nthe limit or\n20 grams there would have been 50 units of postage\nper kilo but of\ncourse many letters weighed much less than the limit and others which\ncarried two units of postage weighed less than 40\ngrams.\nIt happened\nwithout exception that each semi-annual test showed\nthat the mail ran\n84 letters or units to the kilo\nSO\nthe airline got 21 dollars per kilo\nor expressed in U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate about $3.20\nper pound - a very good rate.\nWe had lots\nof trouble in China with\n\"face\" but we put that national\ntrait to\ngood\nuse\nby advertising\nthat if your letter was important it\nwas sent by airmail.\nThe result was that many letters went by air\njust because the\nsender didn't want to lose face.\nPan American bought the American interest in C.N.A.C. in April 1953â€¢\nThe first meeting of the Board which I attended was\ncalled to consider\nwhether or not the Directors would declare the company insolvent!\nUnder Chinese Company law if\nthe directors knew\nor had reason to be-\nlieve that\ntheir company\nwas insolvent and failed to announce that\nfact each of them was personally responsible for the debts of the\ncompany. Actually the company had not been able to pay its bills for\noil\nand\ngasoline\nand owed\nquite a lot of money\nto different suppliers\nbut it was pointed out to the\ndirectors that with Pan American spon-\nsorship things would get better - but we did not know just how.\nany rate the directors agreed\nto postpone the announcement and also\nagreed\nto eliminate a zone system which had been in effect for airmail\nand follow Pan American's suggestion to have only one zone for all\nChina so\nas to popularize and simplify the use of airmail. That was\nthe turning point and we soon started making modest earnings which\nenabled us\npay off our creditors.\nthat time C.N.A.C. had\nbeen so poor that no Chinese official had tried to get squeeze from\nthe company or put any of his poor\nrelatives on such an uncertain\npayroll.\nAs we gradually got out of debt\nand started to pile up\ncash balances we\nrealized that a lot of cash would simply open the\ndoors to a flood\nof demands from Chinese polititians for squeeze and\nfavors.\nSo realizing that polititians from F.D.R. down or up are\nincapable of reading\nor understanding a financial\nstatement we started\nbuying certificates of deposit from Chinese banks (at 8% interest)\nand\ncarrying such in our financial statements as\n\"bills receivable\"\nSEPO-IST.
