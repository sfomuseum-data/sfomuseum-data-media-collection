      "Back in 1928 the then great powers were manoeuvering for position in\nthe, Chinese aviation market - military and commercial.\nThe British\nThrough commercial Imperial Airwayd and military Far Bast Aviation.\nThe French were using their sphere of influence in Yunnan-fu later\ncalled Kunming which they had joined to Hanoi in French Indo China\nby a railroad\nto promote French aviation.\nflown a number of\nFrench\nplanes\nout to Indo China and\nthen on to Chungking where the\nwarlord of that province Liu Hsiang (sp?) was unable to\nsecure an im-\nport permit to bring in airplanes, parts, gasoline or oil.\nThe\nSO-\ncalled\nCentral Government which controlled Shanghai would\nnot issue\nits Huchow or import permit for any of the interior warlords but re-\nserved\nThe Germans had formed a company\ncalled Eur-\nasia which was owned\nGovernment and\nthe German\nLuft Hansa one third for the purpose of establishing air-\ntransport lines in China. C.M.Keyes, President of Curtiss Aeroplane\nthe Aviation Exploration Co. and organized\nthe Aviation Exploration do and organized an expedition to onit\nunder the leadership of our\nold friend Wn. B. Robertson of St. Louis.\nIt was a bizarre collection of misfits.\nA lawyer who knew nothing\nwhatever about Chinese Company law, while Shanghai had many able\nAmerican lawyers who did.\nAn\ninterpreter who spoke only Cantonese\nto deal with officials who spoke only the northern dislect and\ncould\nnot understand a word he\nsaid in Chinese but most of them spoke good\nEnglish so it didn't matter. A pilot with a Loening Amphibian.\nThey\nnegotiated an airmail contract with\nSun Fo the son of Sun Yat-sen the\nGeorge Washington of China but Sun Fo's reputation was sonething less\nimpressive than that of Caesar's wife.\nThen too he was at\nthe time\nMinister of Railways which Ministry had nothing whatever to do with\nmail\nas\nthat\nwas\nthe\nbusiness of\nthe Ministry of Communications.\ncontract was wonderful but it\njust happened\nThe\nfit.\nmail\nThe Minister\nto be with the wrong out-\nor\nmake the\nof Communications refused to give the company any\nsubsidy\nhe set up his\nown\nmonoplanes to be\nrival\npayments\ncalled for by the contract.\nInstead\nairline and bought five Stinson single motor\nmanaged\nand flown by Chinese pilots.\nAs\nboth companies\na result\nlost money at\nsuch an alarming rate that C. M.\nKeyes\nemployed Max Polin, a Shanghai business man to work out a consolidation\nof the two\ncompanies.\nto this proposal\nThe Minister of Communications readily agreed\nunder\nbecause not only was his company losing money but\nthe Chinese management they were also losing airplanes and he\nwas quite prepared\nto set up a new company under American\noperating\nmanagers.\nThe new\ned\ncompany - China National Aviation Corp.\n- was form-\nwith\nthe Ministry of Communications owning 51% and the\nCurtiss int-\nerests\nowning\nthe other 49%.\nThe new company was to have\nShanghai to Peiping, Shanghai to Chungking\nand\nthree routes\nChengtu,\nShanghai to\nCanton.\nThere were\nto be seven directors - four representing\nthe\nChinese interests\nand three the American.\nThere were\nto be\nthree\ndepartments - the Business Dept. with a Chinese manager and an American\nAssistant - the Finance Department with the\nsame arrangement and an\nOperating Dept. with an American manager and a Chinese assistant. The\nPresident was to be Chinese and\nthe Vice-President American. All\nthe\nChinese personnel wanted to get into the Operations Department because\nemployment\nwas secure there\nment usually\nwhile in the Chinese run divisions employ-\nended with a change of political leadership - not infrege",
      "ent because the Minister of\nCommunications seldom held office for more\nthan a\nfew years and each new appointee wanted to have his own team.\nThe company did not receive any\nsubsidy from the Chinese Government.\nIts only revenue came from the\ncarriage of passengers and airmail\nwhich was carried under a unique and most satisfactory arrangement.\nIf a letter was sent by ordinary mail the sender put on a five cent\nstamp and from\nthat revenue the Post Office had to\npay for rail or\nboat transportation.\nIf the letter was sent airmail the sender added\nto the five cent\nstamp whatever the airmail postage cost and\nthis entire\nsurcharge went to the airline. So that the premiun for airmail service\nwent to\nthe company which provided the expedited service while the\nPost Office retained the five cents to cover local pickup and delivery.\nEvery six months the Post Office, with representatives of the airline\npresent, counted the number of units of mail\nper kilo (2.2 lbs) and\nthat became the basis of payment by the Post Office to the airline for\nthe next\nsix months. The unit of mail was 20 grams and\nthe airmail\nsur-\ncharge was 25 cents so that if each letter had\nweighed\nthe limit or\n20 grams there would have been 50 units of postage\nper kilo but of\ncourse many letters weighed much less than the limit and others which\ncarried two units of postage weighed less than 40\ngrams.\nIt happened\nwithout exception that each semi-annual test showed\nthat the mail ran\n84 letters or units to the kilo\nSO\nthe airline got 21 dollars per kilo\nor expressed in U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate about $3.20\nper pound - a very good rate.\nWe had lots\nof trouble in China with\n\"face\" but we put that national\ntrait to\ngood\nuse\nby advertising\nthat if your letter was important it\nwas sent by airmail.\nThe result was that many letters went by air\njust because the\nsender didn't want to lose face.\nPan American bought the American interest in C.N.A.C. in April 1953â€¢\nThe first meeting of the Board which I attended was\ncalled to consider\nwhether or not the Directors would declare the company insolvent!\nUnder Chinese Company law if\nthe directors knew\nor had reason to be-\nlieve that\ntheir company\nwas insolvent and failed to announce that\nfact each of them was personally responsible for the debts of the\ncompany. Actually the company had not been able to pay its bills for\noil\nand\ngasoline\nand owed\nquite a lot of money\nto different suppliers\nbut it was pointed out to the\ndirectors that with Pan American spon-\nsorship things would get better - but we did not know just how.\nany rate the directors agreed\nto postpone the announcement and also\nagreed\nto eliminate a zone system which had been in effect for airmail\nand follow Pan American's suggestion to have only one zone for all\nChina so\nas to popularize and simplify the use of airmail. That was\nthe turning point and we soon started making modest earnings which\nenabled us\npay off our creditors.\nthat time C.N.A.C. had\nbeen so poor that no Chinese official had tried to get squeeze from\nthe company or put any of his poor\nrelatives on such an uncertain\npayroll.\nAs we gradually got out of debt\nand started to pile up\ncash balances we\nrealized that a lot of cash would simply open the\ndoors to a flood\nof demands from Chinese polititians for squeeze and\nfavors.\nSo realizing that polititians from F.D.R. down or up are\nincapable of reading\nor understanding a financial\nstatement we started\nbuying certificates of deposit from Chinese banks (at 8% interest)\nand\ncarrying such in our financial statements as\n\"bills receivable\"\nSEPO-IST. PIOS",
      "instead\nof cash on deposit.\nWe showed a very small amount of cash on\ndeposit which was always smaller than our \"accounts\npayable\"\nand\nthe\nChinese politicoes still thought we were as poor picking as the mission-\naries and left us alone.\nOne one of my trips home the Comptroller of\nPan American asked why a company which sold its services only for cash\nshould have as by\nthen we did\nthree million dollars in \"bills receivable\".\nWhen I told him the reason he hit the roof and we finally had to go to\nPresident Trippe for a decision.\nWhen the latter understood the situation\nhe had a good\nlaugh and\nsaid \"Bix - you win in a walk.\"\nYou will hear it\nsaid that no company ever opperated in China without paying squeeze to\nChinese officials but we did.\nThe nearest we ever came to paying squeeze\nwas when I reluctantly agreed to the purchase of a white jade bowl which\nwas stolen from the Peiping treasures for presentation to an official\nwho was\nretiring as President of the compant.\nHe had\npurchased the bowl\nand had\ninscribed\non a little plate on the stand \" to (his name) from\nC.N.A.C. Your service to this company was like the quality of\nthis jade\".\nIt was true that his\nservices were about as disreputable as the acquisi-\ntion of that bowl.\nHe was the one who was describing a tiger hunt he had.\nbeen on down in Indo China. It was at a dinner party given by the Minister\nof Communications.\nOur hero said that he was stationed in a small tree\nwith the bait - a lamb - tied to a stake below him.\nThe tiger walked all\naround the tree before our Chinese friend\ncould get a bead on him.\nI said\n\"K.C. if you had fallen out of that tree I'd bet\non you and\nthe first bite.\"\ngive\nthe tiger\nThe Minister nearly died laughing\nparticular Chinese was always called\n\"Tiger\".\nand\nafter\nthat this\nSpeaking of \"squeeze\" one of our pilots left the company and got a job\nas\nthe representative of an aviation company intent\non selling aircraft\nto the Chinese Government.\nNot meeing with any success our ex-pilot\napproached\nthe American Commercial Attache in Shanghai\nand said\nbluntly\n\"I want to know how you pay squeeze.\"\nThe Attache\nrather\nsaid\n\"that's\nsort of asking how you make a girl - some you just say\n\"how's about it'\nwhile with others you have to use a little more finesse.\""
