    "media:imagetext": "WATER LANDINGS\nA water landing in a land aircraft is a highly unlikely event; however if this\nremote possibility should occur, it is imperative that you be familiar with the\nequipment on board and procedures for a safe and orderly exit into the life\nrafts.\nLIFE VESTS. Life vests, packed in a plastic pouch, are located underneath\nyour seats. The cabin attendants will instruct you as to their location, and\ndemonstrate the use of your life vest. (Life rafts and vests not on all\naircraft.)\nCREW ASSIGNMENTS. Members of the crew will be assigned to the\npassenger compartment. It may be necessary to ask you to move to a dif-\nferent location in the plane to facilitate evacuation of the aircraft. If so, your\nprompt cooperation will be appreciated. Await instructions from the crew,\nbut be prepared to follow them explicitly.\nDITCHING PROCEDURE. In the event it is necessary to land on water,\nappropriate announcements will be made on the aircraft's public address\nsystem, and the cabin attendant will instruct you as to the action to be\ntaken. Immediately after this warning proceed as follows:\n1. Cease smoking or using cigarette lighters or matches, and don coat if\nconveniently available.\n2. Remove glasses, high-heeled shoes and sharp pocket objects, and\nloosen collar and tie.\n3. Put on vest as demonstrated, adjust straps so that vest fits snug. DO\nNOT INFLATE AT THIS TIME.\n4. Place seat in full upright position unless otherwise instructed by cabin\nattendant.\n5. Fasten seat belt tightly ... uncomfortably so. Assume the brace\nposition as instructed.\n6. At P.A. announcement \"Brace for impact,\" and six rapid call bells,\nbrace yourself for a minimum of two impacts. This will occur within a\nfew seconds. (Generally two shocks will be felt, the second slightly\nmore severe than the first.)\n7. Do not move until the aircraft has come to a complete stop on the\nwater. Unfasten seat belts only when aircraft has reached a complete\nstop. Remain in seat until instructed to board life raft by crew\nmembers. Do not inflate life vest until after leaving aircraft.\nLIFE RAFT PROCEDURE. After the water landing has been completed,\ncrew members will issue directions to your proper life raft station and will\ntell you how and in what order to board the life raft. Normally one crew\nmember will be in each life raft and will be in charge. Sufficient life rafts for\nall passengers and crew members are carried aboard all Ozark Air Lines ex-\ntended over-water aircraft. Each raft is equipped for maximum safety and\nfor the most comfort possible.\nAIR SEARCH AND RESCUE. The aircraft is in constant radio contact\nwith international air search and rescue bases. In the event of a water lan-\nding, this highly efficient organization goes into action. Radio-equipped\nplanes are instantly dispatched carrying droppable lifeboats and other\nemergency equipment. All ships at sea are informed of the exact position of\nthe airplane in distress.\nIt is possible for these operations to be initiated hours before the water lan-\nding is actually performed and rescue procedures can be completed in a\nmatter of a few hours. A maximum of safety can be assured by following\nprecisely the instructions of crew members.",
